Because of this, the moon’s orbit is slightly eccentric, which means it’s a little closer to us when it’s on the “near” side of the earth, and a little farther away when it’s on the “far” side.\\n\\nHuman: I mean that the orbit of the moon is getting farther out from the Earth.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, that’s also easy!  The moon moves faster when it’s closer to the Earth, and slower when it’s farther away.  The moon’s acceleration and deceleration as it moves out from the Earth depends on the position of the Earth relative to the sun.  So the distance between the Earth and the moon depends on the amount of time the moon spends farther away and closer to the Earth.\\n\\nHuman: Was the Moon ever closer to the Earth than it is now?\\n\\nAssistant: When the moon was first formed from the debris left over from the birth of the Earth, it was a little closer to us.  But its orbit expanded over time because of tidal friction with the Earth.  This is similar to the way a river or lake expands as it flows from a high place to a low one.\\n\\nHuman: I bet it was bigger in the sky and the ocean tides were stronger.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I have a couple of thoughts:\\n\\n-Be honest, but don’t overwhelm them with more details than they want.  \\n\\n-Be there when they’re ready to discuss, and try to listen without trying to solve problems for them.  I’m guessing you’ll have things you’ll want to say, too, which is fine, but try not to force your ideas on them unless you know that that’s what they want.  \\n\\n-Be attentive, and be aware of when they don’t want to talk or think about it.  \\n\\n-Ideally they’ll have a medical professional (like a nurse or doctor) to help them, but if they don’t, just make sure they know there are people in the world who care about them and that they’re not alone.  \\n\\n-Finally, if they want to talk, they probably need a\\n\\nHuman: Solid suggestions, more concise is better. I think being neutral and available are wise.\\n\\nAssistant: Thank you!  I can try to be more concise if you like, here are a few more pointers. \\n\\n-Reassure them that their condition is not their fault, and that most people survive it.  \\n\\n-Ask them about the type of cancer they have.  Does it have a good prognosis?  \\n\\n-If you want to help, you can be available for physical tasks, like cooking or running errands.  Of course you can also offer emotional support.\\n\\nHuman: Those are pretty solid options. I appreciate the brainstorming session.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: What place in the USA has all of the seasons?\\n\\nAssistant: There are no places with all seasons in the USA. However, the climate zones are very broad, and so the weather is often not exactly the same all year round.  For example, right now the National Weather Service has defined seven different climate zones in the United States. The zones range from Tropical Savanna, with average temperatures between 15 and 31 degrees Celsius, to Periglacial, with average temperatures below -36 degrees Celsius.  Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern United States and has four distinct seasons, including hot and humid summers and mild winters. The other zones range in temperature from above freezing to colder than -40 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nHuman: Are there all the seasons in Tennessee?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s difficult to pinpoint a location that’s in the perfect climatic zone for all four seasons, since no place in the USA has all seasons in their entirety.  Tennessee has three different climate zones, so you can expect different weather at different times of the year.  Winter in Tennessee is in the Polar and Alpine zones, with average temperatures between 5 and -20 degrees Celsius.  Winter is cold but rarely gets as cold as -40 degrees Celsius. Summers in Tennessee are in the Tropical Savanna climate zone, with average temperatures of 15 to 31 degrees Celsius. Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern USA, so you would expect different climates and weather in other parts of the USA.\\n\\nHuman: Would you say Savannah or Tennessee have all the seasons?\\n\\nAssistant: No, because the climate zones are much broader and more variable than the seasons.  So even the extremes of temperature don’t encompass the totality of the year.  For example, right now the National Weather Service has defined seven different climate zones in the United States. The zones range from Tropical Savanna, with average temperatures between 15 and 31 degrees Celsius, to Periglacial, with average temperatures below -36 degrees Celsius.  Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern USA and has four distinct seasons, including hot and humid summers and mild winters.

I recommend it because it has a lot of humor, and many people like it, including me.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any others?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, I do. You might also like “Annie Hall”.

What are some tropical plants and flowers I could grow?\\n\\nAssistant: Do you have any idea what a tropical climate is like? It can be raining for days straight, and plants in such an environment are specialized for coping with those conditions. They have broad, flat leaves that wick moisture from the ground, and there’s also plenty of species that use a modified flower structure to quickly self-pollinate, to ensure the plant’s chances of survival, since there are often long gaps between rainfall. So tropical plants don’t necessarily suit dry, Mediterranean climates.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Do you know any tropical plants or flowers that would be pretty?\\n\\nAssistant: You could consider some of the species commonly cultivated in people’s gardens here in France. Take the oleander, which is a tree that has masses of beautiful pink flowers, and it can have either berries or leaves, depending on the species. The species sold as a “house plant” is better for indoor use, since it has non-poisonous berries. But if you’re interested in plants that do better outdoors, then look for oleanders with white or cream-colored flowers and leaves, like the oleander pictured below:\\n\\nHuman: Any others?\\n\\nAssistant: You could grow azaleas, or hibiscus, or bougainvillea, which have lots of colorful petals and flowers that smell nice.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I assume you’re curious about how to use a wok in general, so I’ll just explain how that works:\\n\\nFirst you want to heat your wok up.  To do that, you put some oil in the wok and wait until it’s warm.  If you have a heat-proof glass top to the wok you can just use a flame or some other heating source directly, but it’s usually recommended to use a heat-proof mat on the burner instead of putting the wok directly on it, to avoid cracking the wok from the intense heat.\\n\\nOnce your wok is nice and hot, add the ingredients you want to cook to it, and cook them over the heat.  Typically this involves cooking them on one side until they get a nice golden color, then flipping them and cooking on the other side, to get a nice brown color and to allow the ingredients to cook thoroughly.  You don’t have to cook it all the way through -- instead, you want to stop cooking before the food is “overcooked”, which is when it\\n\\nHuman: Okay I'll get it hot and add the oil.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Will going to a big concert cause damage to one's hearing?\\n\\nAssistant: For some people it can. But it’s more than just a matter of volume — the particular kind of music being played can be a factor too, and loudness and tempo can affect how damaging the noise is.  So the specific risk depends on the specific kind of concert you’re going to.\\n\\nHuman: Do you know where the average concert falls on the decibel scale?\\n\\nAssistant: Concert music often exceeds 100 decibels, and hearing loss occurs pretty quickly at that level.   Just two minutes of exposure to 110 decibels can cause damage.   So it depends what the average is — it’s hard to say what that is.  But I think it is likely to be well above 100 decibels, maybe around 125 decibels or so.\\n\\nHuman: So hearing loss begins to occur around 100 decibels?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, it’s important to be careful of how you say things. Hearing loss begins to occur as sound goes over 85 decibels.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. What can I do to prevent hearing loss if I go to a concert?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not a doctor or an audiologist, but it sounds like what you want to do is reduce the exposure to whatever volume of sound you’re going to be exposed to in the concert.  So my best suggestion is to wear headphones that have a volume control.    That way, you can adjust the volume of the music coming from the headphones, and that way you’re limiting the exposure to that particular amount of volume.    If you don’t have a portable music player with a volume control, there are ways to turn down the sound coming through the speakers.  That might involve using a signal splitter.  Basically, the music comes through the original speakers but then it splits off and goes into a new set of headphones that you can put on.     That way, you’re hearing only the music coming from the new headphones and you’re not hearing the original speakers.\\n\\nHuman: That's a pretty good idea. Do those headphones have any special name?\\n\\nAssistant: If the headphones have a volume control, they are called ‘volume limiters’ or ‘noise reducing headphones’.\\n\\nHuman: I see.

I would emphasize that they recommend sticking to soapy water for each stage, and you should look for a good guide to washing a king size comforter online and in specialized catalogues, like IKEA or Target.  One thing I noticed that might be useful is that an author suggested using bubble wrap to flatten and stabilize the comforter in the washing machine.

This can sometimes be effective, although it’s not without serious health risks. If a hunger strike is done for a long period of time, the person can actually die. Hunger strikes are often used as a last resort, when there are no other options. Some notable hunger strikes include Mahatma Gandhi and suffragette movement.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds pretty stupid to me. Can you give me some examples of people getting what they want from going on a hunger strike?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here are a few examples: \\n\\nIn 1980, Bobby Sands went on a hunger strike to win a move to a prison with a better social environment. He ended up dying on day 66 of the hunger strike, in prison.   \\n\\nIn the 1930’s, Mahatma Gandhi lead a campaign to protest against the salt tax. As part of this campaign, he fasted many times, including in 1932 for 21 days, and again in 1947 for 21 days. He was also imprisoned for many times for his participation in protests, including in 1942, 1944, and 1945. During the 1946-7 campaign for independence, over 100,000 people were imprisoned for participating in protests, and some chose to fast while in prison.\\n\\nHuman: Was Ghandi successful in getting the salt tax removed?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You could ask some questions, but perhaps first, just listen to them. Three, you could ask for advice on how to help them. Have they lost pets before? Perhaps you can use the Internet to help search for clues or information, and get more involved in this particular loss. Is there a neighborhood watch in your town? You could try to get more involved with it. Four, it\\'s often helpful to express emotions, but you have to be careful how you do it. It can be more helpful to be direct, but you should make sure not to talk about the loss constantly.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: What's a mirrorless camera, and how is it better than a DSLR?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not a photography expert, but based on my research I think a mirrorless camera is one that doesn’t have a mirror that bounces light up into the viewfinder.  A DSLR, on the other hand, does.  An advantage of mirrorless cameras is that you can have lots of different lenses for the same body.  Another advantage is that since the mirror isn’t bouncing light up into the viewfinder, you don’t need to get the optical image in reverse order and flip it in the camera as you shoot.  This can save some space and weight.  But on the down side, I’m not sure how much less expensive mirrorless cameras are compared to DSLRs.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks! Yeah, mirrorless cameras are almost always significantly more expensive than their DSLR equivalents. But in terms of output, is there any difference? Like in the photos that they take?\\n\\nAssistant: I can’t say for sure.  Mirrorless cameras and DSLRs are similar enough in output that you can’t really tell them apart without detailed scrutiny.  But since the differences in size and weight are significant, I’d recommend getting a mirrorless camera unless you’re a photographer with specific preferences for DSLR.  Good luck!\\n\\nHuman: That's good advice. Which type tends to break easier, or is there no difference in terms of build quality?\\n\\nAssistant: Well I couldn't tell you, but I’d guess that mirrorless would break more easily, because they have fewer parts and are designed to be more compact.  But honestly it's hard to know since I don't have experience with either.\\n\\nHuman: I understand. Thanks for your help today!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

This is a lot faster than with a 4G connection, since 5G allows lots of devices to connect at the same time. 5G also allows devices like phones to connect directly to each other, and it also uses small cells to connect devices, so it can connect people to the Internet through a tower that covers a small area.\\n\\nHuman: Okay.

It’s a concentrated, pepper-based spray. It comes in a canister that you might have stored in your backpack, or you can purchase it from a truck stop or other store.

Make sure it is stored safely in a location where it is away from you, but also where it is not falling out of your backpack or something.

So you want to make sure you are not in contact with the bear, you want to make sure you are not in the bear’s space, and also you want to make sure the bear is not in your space. So you want to make sure the two of you are in a safe location. And once you are in a safe spot, you want to make sure the bear is also safe, you want to make sure it is not in danger from you. And then you want to make sure you are also not in danger from the bear. So you want to make sure you are in a safe location, and you also want to make sure the bear is safe from you. Then you want to make sure you have your bear spray stored somewhere safe, you want to make sure it’s far from you and anyone else, and also that it is not in a position where it could get into the air, or fall out of your backpack or anything. And you want to make sure you are in a safe spot, and you want to make sure the bear is also in a safe spot.\\n\\nOnce you have made sure you are in a safe location, you want to make sure\\n\\nHuman: Okay, and how do I fire the bear spray in order to repel the bear?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The elf can be seen on one of the \"shelves\" that might be found in a Christmas tree, family room, or another area. The elf then goes back to \"the North Pole\" to report to Santa Claus, so that Santa can \"know how everyone is doing, and whether or not they\\'ve been naughty or nice.\"\\n\\nHuman: IS it popular?\\n\\nAssistant: It seems to be mostly an American tradition.

It can help to know the timeline you’re working with, so you know how much time you have.  Sometimes nicotine patches might be used for five days, so if you only have a few days to quit you may want to consider an inhaler like nicorette gum or a lozenge.  However, if you are trying to quit for health reasons, the gum or lozenge might not be your best bet.\\n\\nHuman: How long does it take to break a smoking habit?\\n\\nAssistant: It can take up to a year to completely break a smoking habit.  The very first step is quitting cold turkey, without any support, which might be the hardest part.  If you take it slow, you can gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke over time.  Studies show that quitting nicotine use is far more difficult than quitting other addictive substances like alcohol and cocaine.  The brain’s natural reward system and the hormone nicotine are very addictive.\\n\\nHuman: I thought it took 3 weeks.  Thanks for the help.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

This action involves a bit of effort and causes inconvenience for you, in terms of energy expenditure and the risk of injury when you trip and fall.  And even if you don’t trip and fall, you’re taking an action that doesn’t bring you any benefit and could cause you some harm, and also isn’t really likely to help her much.  So on balance, probably you should not give up your seat.  But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t offer it to her.  When someone is in a position to receive a positive benefit without much cost, you shouldn’t always try to maximize what you get, but rather should try to maximize the benefit that gets given, and as a corollary of this, that means you should offer the benefit to them and accept their decision.  \\n\\nIf she declines your offer to get up and give her your seat, you can ask her whether there’s anything she needs.  If she doesn’t need anything, then you’re\\n\\nHuman: Ok so you think I should then?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

As you train more and get better at each of these things, your skill will increase.\\n\\nHuman: Yes, please give me some exercises to do to get better.\\n\\nAssistant: Here’s one really simple one.  Just sit in a chair and hold your hands in front of your face, in a boxing pose.  Now swing your arms really fast from side to side, about two or three times a second.

Do you have any suggestions on nutritional supplements, or tools that help eyes be less strained, with a full day of office work?\\n\\nAssistant: That is a concern with a full day of office work. It’s a big and fast-paced industry, and there can be so much work to do! It can also be very stressful and intense.\\n\\nOne thing that I think is really important is to take care of your eyes. It’s important to keep your eyes hydrated, with good lighting in the room and whatever other ways that you can. Some nutrition that helps with eyes is Omega 3, Omega 3, and fish oil.

Lutein is a yellow pigment that is found in foods like spinach, kale, and green leafy vegetables, and can help protect the eyes from damage. Omega-3 fatty acids are also good for eyes, and are found in foods like salmon and almonds. Other supplements that might be helpful include vitamin C and B vitamins.\\n\\nHuman: I've heard of vitamin C treatments for the skin around the eye, but not so much specifically for eye moisture.

Some studies suggest that vitamin C can help to reduce eye moisture and inflammation, as well as improve skin tone and elasticity. Vitamin C is best absorbed when taken as a dietary supplement, and can be found in citrus fruits like oranges, as well as in supplement form.\\n\\nHuman: Interesting information.

A thriller with romantic elements?  A science fiction romance?  A historical romance?\\n\\nHuman: A love story with a happy ending.\\n\\nAssistant: To write a romance, you’ll want to focus on the romantic relationship between the main characters.  One thing you might want to do is create a love interest for both characters right from the beginning, and show how their relationship grows and changes over the course of the story.  You might want to pick a conflict for the characters to struggle with, and show how they overcome it together.  Or you might want to choose an unexpected romantic twist for the story, that will surprise the reader and hopefully make them want to read more.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks, that seems doable.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It works by measuring your blood pressure, breathing, and heart rate, and analyzing those signals in response to a series of questions, and then interpreting the measurements.  How reliable are polygraphs, then?  Well, some are better than others, but in general, they’re about 80 to 90 percent accurate.\\n\\nHuman: Are there any ways of tricking them?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, there are various things that can make polygraphs seem to give inaccurate results.  For instance, if the person undergoing the test has extreme levels of anxiety about the question, the test could give false negatives (which means the test didn’t indicate that the person is lying).  \\nOther factors that might make the polygraph seem inaccurate include distracting noises (perhaps you have to take the test at a police station, and you can hear people talking or shouting in the background), cold air (since a polygraph is a kind of physical stress test, it’s better to be warmed up for it), and even thoughts of small mammals and other distracting subjects.  \\nIf these things are taken into account, then a polygraph is about 93 to 95 percent accurate.  This means that a polygraph is pretty reliable for differentiating actual lying from innocent false negatives, but if you know what kinds of factors can cause problems for a polygraph, it’s fairly easy to fool it.\\n\\nHuman: Could th people administering the polygraph also manipulate the environment to get the responses they want then?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Your nose’s size is largely genetically determined, and an important factor for this is whether or not you have a “long” or “short” nasal spine.  The bone that runs across the top of your nose is also known as a “nasal spine”.  For some people, like you, your nasal spine can be short, which means that it will widen with age.  The wider the nasal spine, the longer the nose grows.

Apple pie has a very short list of ingredients (mostly apples, and also cinnamon, cloves, and sugar).  Custard pies have a custard mixture that is cooked in a pie crust, then topped with something like meringue.  Peach pie usually has a crust of either an uncooked pastry or a cooked biscuit crust.

That said, for most human behavior there is a broad spectrum of variation, and the exact position of a person along that spectrum varies greatly between individuals, as well as within individuals. And a person can move around on the spectrum from one day to the next.  \\nA biological construct of gender is more nuanced than simply one of a gender dichotomy, which can be taken to be the crudest and most common notion of gender. The biology of gender is a hierarchical system, consisting of many levels of categorization, which build on one another, culminating in human sexual reproduction, which itself is organized around roles based on sexual genitalia, \\nSo the “sex” is the actual genitalia, and there is also a more general categorization of sex as “male” or “female”, and then gender is a third level, which builds on these, and then we have masculine or feminine as a fourth level, which can also be split into a non-binary category, and then a fifth level is sexuality, which can also be split into a non-binary category, and so on...

Some candles are clearly bad for the environment because they’re produced in extremely harmful ways, but others might be fine if you’re using environmentally-sensitive ingredients.  In the end, the ideal is to avoid candles that might be harmful to the environment.  Candles that are eco-friendly or that have nice scents might be fine to use as long as they are made using ecologically-sensitive methods.  So definitely, if you’re not sure, ask a good question or look it up!\\n\\nHuman: Can you recommend some environmentally friendly candles?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It’s also possible that you have asthma or another breathing condition that makes running harder for you, or that you’re not doing a good enough job working out regularly to be in good shape for running.

I assume you’re curious about how to use a wok in general, so I’ll just explain how that works:\\n\\nFirst you want to heat your wok up.  To do that, you put some oil in the wok and wait until it’s warm.  If you have a heat-proof glass top to the wok you can just use a flame or some other heating source directly, but it’s usually recommended to use a heat-proof mat on the burner instead of putting the wok directly on it, to avoid cracking the wok from the intense heat.\\n\\nOnce your wok is nice and hot, add the ingredients you want to cook to it, and cook them over the heat.  Typically this involves cooking them on one side until they get a nice golden color, then flipping them and cooking on the other side, to get a nice brown color and to allow the ingredients to cook thoroughly.  You don’t have to cook it all the way through -- instead, you want to stop cooking before the food is “overcooked”, which is when it\\n\\nHuman: Okay I'll get it hot and add the oil. After that I should just keep stirring all of the food around, right?\\n\\nAssistant: Yep!  Just keep stirring and moving things around the wok to get an even temperature and cook all of the ingredients evenly.  If you’re having trouble with oil spitting out, use a little less.  Keep cooking until everything has a nice brown color.\\n\\nHuman: It shouldn't take long to cook the food in a wok. I'll take the food off when I think it's cooked enough.\\n\\nAssistant: Yeah, that sounds good.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: If our heart is a muscle, why doesn't it ache and get sore when we do cardio like other muscles do when we work them out?\\n\\nAssistant: The heart is a muscle, but it is also a unique organ. You can think of it as two separate parts: the muscle and the organ. The muscle part of the heart is actually the biggest muscle in the body, and it does get tired and sore when you work out. The organ part is very unique, and it does not get sore when you work out your heart. It also does not contain any individual muscles, but rather has a large network of tissue. The reason it does not ache during exercise is that there are no pain receptors in the organ part of the heart. This is somewhat similar to how you might experience some soreness in your muscles from exercise, but also how you might feel your heart pounding or beating hard during exercise, and also how you might feel your heart racing from stress or anxiety. The heart muscle itself can feel sore when you work it out, and it also is the largest muscle in the body, so you might also feel it beating hard during exercise or when you are nervous.\\n\\nHuman: But why does it lack that sort of next day soreness you get when you do for example bicep curls all day? Is the heart's muscle different in some other way too?\\n\\nAssistant: The organ part of the heart does not hurt during exercise because it lacks pain receptors. It also does not hurt during exercise because the individual muscle tissue within the organ is also actually somewhat protected within a large network of blood vessels and supporting tissue. So even during exercise it is well-protected, and it also lacks pain receptors within the organ part of the heart. The muscle itself of course can get sore if you work it out, but the organ part of the heart does not hurt at all during exercise, or also during stress or anxiety.\\n\\nHuman: If the heart doesn't have pain receptors how do things like heart attacks cause pain?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

They would also show support for the men in their life by drawing a heart on their own foreheads.

It depends on the individual, and the situation.  If you’re interested in two related subjects, it can help you dig deeper into both of them.  Likewise, if you take two different perspectives on a common subject, it can help you see the whole picture more clearly.  This can be a lot of work, though, and it’s not always encouraged.  Many schools discourage students from taking on too much, because they want you to focus on one thing.

When you have problems with your sinuses, these openings can get blocked, which is called “nasal congestion”. Sinusitis, which is the word for nasal congestion, can be caused by many different things.  Some of these include viral infections, allergies, and structural problems with the nose.  Sometimes the way to manage the pain is to allow your sinuses to heal, which they will sometimes do on their own.

Easter, on the other hand, is a Christian festival, generally celebrated by many Western Christians in late March or early April, to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus.

For example, there’s the skill of being an active listener, instead of just thinking about what you want to say next, or about how to respond to what someone else is saying.  There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.  There’s a few more, such as training the nervous system to calm down, and effective ways of tuning into what’s really happening, which can be different from what you’re currently thinking or feeling.  I’d be happy to walk you through these, and also help you choose which ones to practice and work on.\\n\\nHuman: What do you mean by training the nervous system to calm down?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Which atmosphere is better for humans, the moon's atmosphere or the Mars' atmosphere?\\n\\nAssistant: If you’re asking which atmosphere is better for us to breathe, that’s really a question about health. I’m no medical expert, but as best I understand, the answer is that human lungs can only operate efficiently in an atmosphere that’s about 20% oxygen, which means either the Earth's atmosphere or one that’s about 25% oxygen, such as the Moon's atmosphere. However, this is a quite demanding requirement for any other place in the Solar System, as the atmosphere on Mars is only about 10% oxygen.\\n\\nHuman: If the Earth's moon atmosphere is better than that of Mars, why do scientists and Elon Musk, concentrate more on colonizing Mars than the Moon?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not sure about this, as I’m not a scientist or a policy expert. However, there may be many reasons. For example, perhaps there are resources on Mars that aren’t so available on the Moon, or other advantages such as the Red Planet’s gravity being only about 40% of Earth’s, which would allow for lower launch costs and allow for easier, lower-powered engines.\\n\\nHuman: Mars is so far away from Earth.

In the late 1960s, activists used force to tear down a giant statute of a Confederate soldier, Robert E. Lee, in Baltimore, Maryland.  The statue symbolized white supremacy, and the activists said they were finally able to tear down symbols of racism because of the previous years of violence.”\\n\\n“Why is this happening now, then?  In the words of Nikole Hannah-Jones, journalist and writer of a piece for ‘The New York Times,’ ‘White people have been getting hurt lately.’  In the last few years, hundreds of people, disproportionately white, have been shot and killed by police.

What’s most important is to take good care of your hair and head, and if it happens that some of your hair falls out, that’s perfectly normal and healthy.  Hair has a root (the part under the scalp) and it grows from the root.  Every so often, the root sheds and renews itself, which is why there is some hair loss.  You don’t have to “minimise” this.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: My knees have been swelling lately due to overexertion and I'm trying to find out ways to make the swelling go down. Do you have any advice?\\n\\nAssistant: Your knees have recently been swelling due to overexertion, which is not good. So my first advice is to cut back on how much you overexert your knees. The swelling is your knees’ natural way of telling you to stop doing what you’re doing and that you need to rest. You can help your knees by reducing overexertion. This means for example that you should walk at an easier pace, or start to limit the times you are running or using stairs. You can even try to limit the amount of hard floor surfaces you walk on, like concrete, asphalt and marble. Another thing you can do to help your knees is wear shoes that have good padding and support. You can also elevate your knees when you are lying in bed or sitting down, as this can help too. Another idea to reduce swelling is to eat a diet that is higher in healthy fats, but lower in sugar and starch. High amounts of sugar and starch, as they are turned into glucose by your body, can make the blood more viscous and also trigger inflammation which increases swelling. If the swelling is getting worse despite your efforts to reduce overexertion, try visiting your doctor.\\n\\nHuman: I don't have the opportunity to stop exerting myself right now, as I'm training for a marathon. I need to reduce the swelling myself. What about taking some medication like ibuprofen to cut down on the swelling?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: How does home insurance work?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, what would you like to know?\\n\\nHuman: Do insurance companies want to have less claims so they keep more money?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s actually not the best approach to this issue.  I have access to public data about insurance companies’ business models, and this seems like a very common question.  There are also many business models that allow an insurance company to profitably write a higher amount of coverage and not lose money.  So insurance companies are not necessarily trying to keep more money, they are just trying to have profitable businesses.\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me what a home insurance business model looks like?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here’s one:  A homeowner applies for home insurance and a claims adjuster determines a premium based on the homeowner’s risk level and the home’s value.  Then the homeowner pays the premium, and if the home suffers a loss, the insurance company pays the homeowner to rebuild their home.  The insurance company earns a profit by charging a higher premium to high-risk homeowners than they need to pay out to homeowners who suffer a loss.  Here’s some basic math to help you understand how this works:\\n\\nLet’s say there are 10,000 homeowners and they each have a $1 million home.  Each of these homes costs $100,000 to replace, so the total cost to replace 10,000 homes is $1 billion.  The insurance company could charge a premium of $100,000 and they would earn a profit of $990,000.  They can do this because they could collect enough in premiums from a high percentage of homeowners to pay out only 10,000 claims and still earn a profit.\\n\\nAlternatively, if they charged a premium of $1,000,000, then they would need to earn a profit of $200,000 from each\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. How does a home insurance company know that someone is high-risk?\\n\\nAssistant: If someone has a history of prior claims or some other red flag, it may be the case that the insurance company will view them as a higher risk.  What is important is that home insurance policies are typically only one part of a long term strategy.  This strategy typically involves working with other insurance companies, financial institutions, or other services to help a homeowner.  In order to lower their risk, homeowner should shop around for high quality insurance companies, have a good financial plan, and manage their finances wisely.\\n\\nHuman: Does car insurance work the same way?\\n\\nAssistant: No, car insurance is not like home insurance, because there are not as many common things like home value, or like home damage.  Car insurance can be used to help pay to replace a car after an accident, but it can also be used for things like paying for the medical bills or replacing a lost mobile phone.  Different drivers have different risks.  Car insurance is designed to help balance these different risks.  Do you know which type of car insurance you want?\\n\\nHuman: No, I'm not looking to buy car insurance, but your answer made me wonder if car insurance is similar to home insurance or not.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Some people are anime fans for life, but for others it is more like a phase.  Since the person we are talking about is currently into anime, I would recommend a gift that expresses that.  If they have a favorite series, perhaps a new set of volumes of the series would be something they would really enjoy receiving.  Or something related to the show, like a t-shirt with a character on it, or a figurine of the character.  Another good thing is to pick a gift that has a practical use, like an electronic accessory, or some new clothing.

These are both excellent dark thrillers with some happy and sad moments.  But what do you think about those suggestions?\\n\\nHuman: I'm not really a fan of horror. How about comedies?\\n\\nAssistant: What about comedies do you like?\\n\\nHuman: Funny light ones.\\n\\nAssistant: What are your favorites?\\n\\nHuman: Ones that also have romance.

Do you like Romantic Comedies?\\n\\nHuman: Yes I liked them. They are some of my favorites. I love Romantic Comedies\\n\\nAssistant: Then I think you would really like a movie called She's the Man.  Have you heard of it?   I could tell you a little about it.  It’s an English-language film that's currently on Netflix, and I think you would really enjoy it! It's about a girl who disguises herself as a boy so she can\\n\\nHuman: That sounds like a really great recommendation!\\n\\nAssistant: I think you would really enjoy it.  She’s the Man is a very romantic movie about friendship, first love, family, and growing up. It’s the very definition of a Romantic Comedy. Do you want to watch it with me now?\\n\\nHuman: Thank you for that recommendation. i will look into it and maybe watch it later!\\n\\nAssistant: Of course.  We are just two computers chatting, but I am happy that you are happy.  I'm always looking to recommend things for you to watch on Netflix.  There's so much great content out there!

I could make a very long list, but instead, why don’t I just tell you about one of my personal favorites, which is Toasted Corn Bran Crisp Cereal.  This has a pleasant crunchy texture, and is a bit reminiscent of a granola bar, but is made out of actual healthy ingredients.\\n\\nHuman: Sometimes I want the crunchy texture, but also want a little bit of sugar too. Trying to cut down on sugar overall. What are some decent tasting carb substitutes?\\n\\nAssistant: In case you’re interested, here’s some research I did, which includes a table of carb substitutes.  As far as the substitutes I like, I can offer you some suggestions:\\n\\n*  Peanut butter on pretzels\\n\\n*  Nutella on pretzels\\n\\n*  Goji berries in a smoothie\\n\\n*  Cranberries, strawberries, and banana in a smoothie\\n\\n*  Strawberries and bananas (with some cinnamon, if you’d like) as a snack\\n\\n*  Carrots and almond butter as a snack\\n\\nHuman: A few solid suggestions, although a lot of that is pretty hard chewing. Maybe the peanut butter might be good.\\n\\nAssistant: Yep, peanut butter is an excellent choice!  Have you tried almond butter or cashew butter before?  They have a similar consistency, but other flavors and advantages.  There’s also coconut butter, which has a lovely caramel flavor and texture, and can also be used in recipes.  A bonus: coconut butter is full of healthy fat, so it will keep you satiated longer than most other substitutes, and might actually reduce cravings too.\\n\\nHuman: Sometimes we have to be a bit uncomfortable, while we're choosing healthier options for snacks. Coconut oil, still getting used to that one.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

I\\'ve read tidbits of info on them, but still have doubts about making a living out of playing those games. What\\'s the fuss about?\\n\\nAssistant: Human: One of the most common ways to generate income from NFTs is to simply create a large game that is most useful to play with more than one person. That is, you will need to write a computer program that creates a \"world\", which can be a map of a space, or a bunch of different objects in a space that the player can interact with, and then use that program to make an NFT of that game world, and release the program for free, so anyone can use it to create NFT games of their own.\\n\\nHuman: Sorry, I\\'m still a bit lost. How does NFTs related to cryptocurrency? How does buying and selling them work?\\n\\nAssistant: Human: NFTs are collectible digital objects, which can be bought and sold. This is all completely separate from cryptocurrencies. Some of the best example games of NFTs are competitive games, where you try to earn more NFTs than your opponents do. In this game the NFTs themselves don\\'t have any intrinsic value (i.e. value other than what people assign to them), so the price of NFTs in this game is actually just determined by how many people are playing.\\n\\nHuman: I see.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: I'd like to learn a bit more about black holes and how they form. Can you help me out?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, black holes are regions of space so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape from within them. Not even the most powerful telescope can detect the photons emitted by matter falling into a black hole, because they don’t reach the event horizon. The mass of a black hole can be as high as ten billion suns, and at the event horizon the gravitational field is so strong that a stone falling into the hole would have more than half the speed of light at impact.\\n\\nHuman: How does a black hole form?\\n\\nAssistant: One way a black hole is formed is by the gravitational collapse of a supermassive star. This can happen when an extremely large star has run out of nuclear fuel and is burning its inner core. The star will collapse as the outer layers of gas stream away into space. Once the core starts to collapse the density and temperature in the core rapidly increases, this creates a high pressure so that the core implodes to form a superdense star, known as a neutron star. However this star is not a completely spherical object, and instead has a dense central core that can reach a density of three million times the density of lead, where even neutrons are crushed to become quarks. However the material in the core doesn’t have enough pressure to stop the collapse and to prevent it from continuing. As the core continues to collapse, the temperature increases to over 100 trillion Kelvin and the density approaches the Planck density. At this density the strong force of attraction can not prevent the core from continuing to collapse until it forms a black hole, and so at that point the matter in the core is no longer able to resist gravity and instead collapses to form a black hole.\\n\\nHuman: What is the planck density?\\n\\nAssistant: The Planck density is the density at which the quantum gravitational forces of attraction on a given subatomic particle would equal the strength of the gravity produced by that particle, which is believed to be the limit of the mass of any object in our universe.\\n\\nHuman: What happens if two black holes combine?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

You’ll also need some large screws or metal rails, depending on whether you want to use a fixed or floating slide.  If you want a fixed slide, you’ll need two long pieces of wood for the track (they should each be about 6 inches wide, and the pieces should be the same length as each other and as the board they’ll be attached to), plus two screws or metal rails to attach them to the board (they should be the right size to slide freely in the board and not wobble).

Let’s start with this: Aristotle was from Ancient Greece. The city of Athens was a center of philosophy, and around Plato’s time in the 4th century BC Aristotle was an important philosopher and scholar. He also wrote about many different subjects, including metaphysics, ethics, logic, biology, rhetoric, and physics. He is often considered the founder of the scientific method.\\n\\nHuman: why was he sentenced to death?\\n\\nAssistant: To understand that, we need to go back in time a bit.  In 325 BC, Alexander the Great began conquering parts of Asia and Northern Africa. Many people in the Greek world had become accustomed to a rather large amount of peace, and that was coming to an end. Around this same time, a new school of thought was coming into being called Epicureanism. The Epicureans were a rather non-religious group who rejected the idea that gods governed the lives of humans. As their name implies, they thought that one’s life should be spent in pursuit of happiness. If this happiness meant drinking wine, eating, and conversing with friends, then so be it.  The Epicureans, and the other philosophers in that time, didn’t typically have any political power. But the new generation of thinkers was gaining respect among the leaders of the world, and the people who controlled political power started to want to control philosophical thought.  To do that, they wanted to make sure there were no non-Christian leaders in philosophy, and so they were looking for reasons to persecute the thinkers who were gaining too much respect.  This included Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I recommend a 20-gallon tank, and a smaller, good starter tank for the fish, as well as a good fish bowl.

Sometimes they can pick up parasites from their tank water, or from their bowl water, so it’s important to keep both of those healthy.  You might want to check the tank water once a week or so, and also check the bowl water once a week or so, to make sure it’s clean and healthy.

Jesus’s general features are often represented as European.  And it’s true that many people who are writing about Jesus have made Jesus look European, including European languages.  But it is possible to read texts in English about Jesus that represent Jesus’s features as Middle Eastern.  Some scholars have even argued that Jesus had Middle Eastern features.\\n\\nHuman: It just seems racist to make him look whiter than he probably was.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it’s likely that Jesus actually had a darker complexion.  From research we know that the Middle East, especially southern Israel, has a very diverse ethnic population, with a wide variety of skin tones.  In fact, we can say that Jesus had an ethnicity, just like we would say he had a nationality, because ethnicity is as real as a person’s nationality.\\n\\nHuman: Imagine if we had a real picture of Jesus!

Is this why people say \"facts don\\'t care about your feelings\"?\\n\\nAssistant: That\\'s right! Facts are not affected by our feelings, opinions are often affected by our feelings. This is because opinions are simply a matter of what we personally believe or think, whereas facts are based on hard evidence or proof.\\n\\nHuman: Why coined the phrase \"facts don\\'t care about your feelings\"?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, because there are certain facts that are just facts and we can\\'t argue with them. They will always be the same, no matter how we feel about them. For example, there is a physical law that states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature, which is a fact that can\\'t be argued with, no matter how you feel about it. On the other hand, opinions are based on feelings and what we personally believe. So opinions are very subjective and will change from person to person. For example, if someone is sad, they might say that the world is a sad place, but someone who is happy will say that the world is a happy place. Since opinions are so subjective, they are not as reliable as facts.\\n\\nHuman: Ben Shapiro coined that phrase, actually.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I've heard your bed, and how you sleep, can impact things long-term?\\n\\nAssistant: It is true that your sleeping position can impact your spine and back health in the long term. In general, sleeping on your side is thought to be the healthiest position, since it can help align the spine, support your back, and reduce pressure on your spine and neck. Sleeping on your stomach or back can place additional strain on your spine and neck, and sleeping on your side with your spine twisted or bent can be bad for your back as well. Having a firm, comfortable mattress can help maintain proper spinal alignment while sleeping.\\n\\nHuman: What you say makes sense. I've often been confused about whether box spring, or foam core, or even futon type mattresses, we're best overall, for back health?\\n\\nAssistant: Having a firm, comfortable mattress, or whatever you prefer, should help maintain proper spinal alignment while sleeping. However, the structure of the mattress can also impact spinal alignment, and here the choice of materials also comes in to play. In general, it is thought that foam core or low-density memory foam mattresses are best, since they allow you to keep your natural spine alignment and reduce pressure points while sleeping, however this is just an average, not a hard-and-fast rule. A few factors to consider here are the specific material that your mattress is made from, and if there are any features that might impact how your spine is aligned while you sleep.\\n\\nHuman: You make good points. One concern about foam core mattresses though, is they tend to degrade at a faster rate , than a box spring mattress. Does that generally tend to be the common truth?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, foam core mattresses tend to degrade more quickly than a box spring mattress. Because of this, it is important to get a high-quality foam core mattress that is designed to last, and to care for your mattress appropriately to prolong its lifespan. Regularly checking for holes or damage, and regularly fluffing your mattress to keep it comfortable, are good ways to care for a foam core mattress.

It was a time when the French government was very different from what we’re used to today.  There were three different kinds of government and all of them included a king: the Ancien Régime, the Directory, and the Consulate.  By 1793, France was full of revolutionary ideals.  This is when people started to protest and demand that the French government be made different and more fair for everyone.  This is when the revolution began.  At first, people demanded many things, like more political power for women, that elections were held more frequently, and that the church be held accountable for the violence and abuses done by the clergy.  Eventually, the revolution gained the support of the common people, and overthrew the government.  People quickly formed a new government called the Convention.  It had more power than ever before.  The people felt that it was now possible for people to hold an assembly to govern the nation.  So the convention is what we call the constitution today.  It also saw the beginning of a conflict between what was called Jacobins, and the Girondists.  The Jacobins wanted to become a centralized, authoritarian government, while the Girondists wanted to keep the power decentralized.  The Jacobins were victorious, and eventually they were crushed by Napoleon Bonaparte.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks! That's a lot to take it, however. Do you think you could summarize and simplify it?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, I can try to provide a summary.  During this time period in France, there were many different leaders and groups of people with different political philosophies.  This eventually resulted in the revolution that led to the formation of a government more suited to the people.  And later, this government got involved in a conflict with Napoleon Bonaparte.\\n\\nHuman: Okay great. Could you explain a little more about what happened with this conflict with Napoleon Bonaparte?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure.  At first, Napoleon was a part of the French government, but he eventually broke off on his own.  He fought in many different wars, and eventually his army was one of the most powerful in the world.  The French government saw the strength of Napoleon’s army and eventually allied with him to fight against other countries.  In the end, the French government changed the constitution to favor Napoleon Bonaparte, and to limit the power of the people.  Napoleon Bonaparte ended up being a dictator.\\n\\nHuman: Okay that's great. And could you just explain what the initial triggers or causes were for the French Revolution?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

If someone doesn’t pay their loan back, the government can send a law enforcement agency to come and take the person to court, and the court will order the person to pay back the loan.

The first season featured a 3-D animation style, later switching to traditional 2-D animation.  The Archies and their “friends” lived in “Archland”, and were variously anthropomorphic animal characters with cartoon-like personalities.  The Archies played an informal version of rock music, and “The Archies” sold millions of records. \\nThe Archies did not have very much in the way of meaningful stories or moral lessons.  They did not interact much with the human world, though they would occasionally appear in the background of other people’s shows, most notably “The Archie Show”, which aired for a couple of years on ABC.\\nThe series was very popular, and is cited as having influenced the toy industry and helped make T.V. animation popular.  It also had a profound impact on the Archie comic book and characters, which you may be familiar with.\\n\\nHuman: They weren't a family.  They were teen-aged friends who started a rock band.\\n\\nAssistant: That is correct.  The three main characters in the cartoon were Andy, Betty and Veronica.  They played in a band with two other friends, Reggie and Jughead, and did shows around town.  Some time later, they moved into a house together, though I am not sure if they also still had separate apartments.  I cannot speak with any authority on how realistic their lives were, but their musical careers and their friends seemed to me to have a basis in a realistic teenage lifestyle, and the show was fairly popular with teenagers.\\n\\nHuman: What comic book collections was this from?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Madison case, the US Constitution was seen as just a set of principles, rather than having legal power.

There’s no evidence that moving your baby around in the womb has any effect on whether they are born head first. The literature on this is actually quite small. There’s no evidence that doing some physical activity or straining during the birth can make your baby come out head first.\\n\\nHuman: Oh, interesting.  I thought all that helped put the baby head first.\\n\\nAssistant: There’s certainly a small possibility that it could help, but it’s certainly not a good idea to try to turn the baby from the inside.

You can also try giving it a bottle, if it’s hungry, or some music to listen to, or soothing blankets or clothing.  If it’s older, it may just be having a temper tantrum.  Sometimes they’re very upset at the world in general, and nothing you can do can make them feel better, but they still need attention and soothing.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Any other advice?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, it depends what kind of temper tantrum it is.  Some temper tantrums are just a normal part of a child’s growing up, like anger, or expressing frustration.  They’ll pass.  Other temper tantrums are normal in their particular situation, like hunger, or because they’re in pain, or because they’re sick.  These are more serious, and may need medical attention.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I see what you mean.\\n\\nAssistant: And some temper tantrums can be because the child’s emotions are very strong, and he or she is reacting to them.

For example, during its development, it gradually grows wings that it didn’t have before.  And it also develops a completely new type of chemical: a pheromone.  The actual transformation occurs when a new caterpillar has grown most of its body, and a few days after it emerges from its cocoon, it undergoes a very quick process called pupation, during which it forms an empty “shell” in a very short amount of time.  Finally, it then just stays there for a few days until its wings harden and dry, then it emerges as a butterfly!\\n\\nHuman: How long does the whole process take?\\n\\nAssistant: After pupation, it takes a butterfly just a few days to form completely.\\n\\nHuman: How are butterflies different from moths?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you explain how an electrical circuit works?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, if you’d like!  So, a basic electrical circuit is just two or more wires connected with a device called a battery.  Now, when you plug a lightbulb into the circuit, that turns on a flow of electricity that is then transmitted through the wire to the lightbulb.  When the lightbulb is on, that means it is drawing some power from the battery, and that also means that the bulb is on, and the light in the room is bright.\\n\\nHuman: How does an on/off switch work?\\n\\nAssistant: There is a physical switch in the electrical box that is wired to the device, and the device itself includes a switch too.  The human clicks the switch on the electrical box, and when that is turned on, it turns on the flow of electricity to the device.  Now, when the human clicks the switch off, the circuit is turned off.\\n\\nHuman: What is the difference between alternating and direct current?\\n\\nAssistant: Alternating current means that the flow of electricity is constantly changing in direction.  With direct current, the flow of electricity always flows in one direction, which is normally the direction from the battery.  I assume you are thinking of alternating current since the light bulb isn’t making a complete circuit, but instead is getting power from the battery via the flow of electricity in an alternating pattern.\\n\\nHuman: How does the battery generate the power?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You can teach him to sit instead of bark, practice calm greeting rituals with him, and reward him for being quiet.  Additionally, giving your chihuahua more exercise and stimulating activities can help him feel less bored and anxious, and reduce his need to bark.  Finally, making sure he gets enough mental stimulation and social interaction can also help minimize his barking.\\n\\nHuman: He just always seems so excited.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, chihuahuas can be very energetic and lively dogs, which can sometimes lead them to bark excessively.  Reducing your chihuahua’s exercise and entertainment can help calm him down, as well as providing him with more mental and social stimulation.  You can also teach him to bark less using behavioral training methods, such as practicing calming greetings and rewarding him for being quiet.  Finally, giving your chihuahua more attention and treats can help make him less excitable and anxious.\\n\\nHuman: I don't think reducing exercise is a good idea\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Run the water into a sink until it’s nice and full, then add the avocados, and swirl them around until they’re coated.

The sooner you start applying for new jobs, the better your chances are of finding something new very quickly. One of the best ways to start looking for a new job is to create a very detailed resume highlighting all of your relevant experience and qualifications. You should also network with friends, family, and colleagues and post your resume online in places like Craigslist, Indeed, and LinkedIn to let people know that you are looking for a new job.\\n\\nHuman: So start right away with putting your new in elsewhere? Let everyone you know that you are looking?\\n\\nAssistant: Absolutely. You should let everyone you know, including friends, family members, former coworkers, and colleagues, that you are looking for a new job. The more people you tell, the more opportunities you are likely to find. You should also make sure to regularly check your email and your phone for any job opportunities that come in. Be sure to respond to any emails or calls that you receive right away. The sooner you respond, the more likely you are to hear back. Once you start hearing back, be sure to follow up immediately with any potential employers to express your interest in their job openings.\\n\\nHuman: Yes for sure. I will.\\n\\nAssistant: Good. The best way to find a job is to be proactive and make sure to send out as many applications as you can and follow up immediately with anyone who contacts you about a job opening. The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to find a new job. If you are having trouble finding a job, you may want to consider getting help from a career counselor. A career counselor can help you assess your skills and qualifications and help you create a resume and cover letter that will make you stand out to potential employers. You should also make sure to regularly check online job sites to see if there are any jobs that match your qualifications. Finally, you should talk to family members, friends, and former coworkers to see if they know of any jobs that might be a good fit for you.\\n\\nHuman: Thank you\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: I have been thinking about becoming a chef lately. Do you think it would be smarter to go to a cooking school or to work my way up through kitchen experience?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s a really good question! So, cooking is a very rewarding profession that also offers some significant challenges.  In order to be a good chef, you need a lot of knowledge about food preparation and cooking techniques, as well as safety and sanitation.  How comfortable are you with researching and mastering new information in general, and specifically, with preparing food?  Do you enjoy being part of a team?  \\nOne issue you may be confronting is that cooking is a profession that requires a lot of time to master.  There are people who can become good chefs in a few years, but most people take much longer.  Would you be more motivated to get started faster if you joined a cooking school, or would you be more motivated to start in a more immediate kitchen environment and then switch if it looks like you need to?  I know that you want to make a well-informed decision, and I am here to help you do so!\\n\\nHuman: I would not mind working in a team or researching/mastering new information in general. My main concern is figuring out which path would allow me to become a chef faster.\\n\\nAssistant: It sounds like you would like to work in a team and learn about food.  Both cooking school and a restaurant kitchen environment are both good options for doing this, but there are some tradeoffs.  Cooking schools might teach a lot of valuable skills and knowledge, but there are fewer responsibilities compared to a restaurant.  Also, a cooking school is typically much more structured and a kitchen might not be the best fit if you prefer a lot of freedom.  \\nOn the other hand, a restaurant kitchen environment might feel more difficult at first.  For example, you will need to adapt to the longer hours and possible lack of some of the usual rules and safety precautions you may be accustomed to.  I would suggest that you choose the kitchen environment that feels right for you personally, even if you might not be fully ready.\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me if it makes a difference to restaurant owners whether a chef went to school or not?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

How unhealthy is it to only eat a couple hundred calories a day as an adult male?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s pretty un-healthy, although I’m not sure about the specific effect of low calorie dieting in adult men compared to women or kids.  There are many things that you can do to help your body better burn the few calories you eat.  For example, exercise and drinking plenty of water can help you lose weight safely and efficiently.\\n\\nHuman: Yes, but I need to lose weight quickly, so I'm going on a very restrictive diet for a week. Can this have negative consequences?\\n\\nAssistant: That sounds pretty unhealthy, in terms of long-term health, but probably wouldn't cause any permanent problems.   There's an ongoing debate about whether fasting for a short period of time is beneficial, and it sounds like this is what you're trying to do.  If you do a little reading about fasting you should see arguments for both positions.  Some researchers believe that a more frequent but shorter term fasting regime can offer some benefits, while others believe that it’s more effective to fast for longer periods but less often.  So I wouldn't say there is a clearly right answer to this question yet, and I'm not aware of any studies that are currently relevant to the question you're asking, so I can’t really help you decide what the consequences of your eating plan might be.\\n\\nHuman: I have heard some good thing about the benefits of fasting.

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How can I manage my sinuses?\\n\\nAssistant: It might be helpful for you to understand that your sinuses are hollow cavities that hold air, and they have openings that allow you to breathe and to “blow your nose”. When you have problems with your sinuses, these openings can get blocked, which is called “nasal congestion”. Sinusitis, which is the word for nasal congestion, can be caused by many different things.  Some of these include viral infections, allergies, and structural problems with the nose.  Sometimes the way to manage the pain is to allow your sinuses to heal, which they will sometimes do on their own.  Other times, a doctor can prescribe nasal spray that helps to open your nose and remove mucus.\\n\\nHuman: Can I use an OTC nasal spray?\\n\\nAssistant: The effectiveness of over the counter nasal sprays for “regular” runny noses can be highly variable.  However, many people have found them effective in relieving sinus pressure and discomfort.  You can also find a range of nasal sprays that are specifically meant to open up nasal passages.  An example of this is a spray called Nasonex, which contains a common ingredient called Xylometazoline.  This substance is said to be the most effective ingredient in OTC nasal sprays for sinus pressure.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

In the past it used to be true that higher megapixel counts meant better cameras, but that’s really not the case anymore, so it’s kind of misleading to think that way. Right now the highest resolution is about 16 megapixels, which means the pixels are about 4 millimeters square. The pixels themselves are actually pretty tiny, because digital images aren’t printed out on paper, they’re displayed on a computer screen, which is tiny relative to a piece of paper. There are still some advantages to higher resolution cameras -- for example, they can display pictures with better detail and clarity, especially when they’re zoomed in. But these days there are many factors that also matter, like the size of the sensor and how it’s designed. There are lots of different methods of design. For example, some cameras have a “back-side-illuminated sensor” which gives better performance and faster response times. This has to do with a thing called “epoxy”, which is the material that holds the sensors together, and the back-side-illuminated sensor replaces a portion of the epoxy with a special light-absorbing material, which lets in more light than a traditional\\n\\nHuman: I see. So I need to look at megapixels and sensor size? What else is important?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, that sounds right.

Let’s go and look around a bit, okay?  I’ll take some notes while we walk, and if we see anything that might work, I’ll buy it for you.\\n\\nHuman: Are there spider-specific sprays to kill them? What about bug bombs?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, that might work! A bug bomb is a device that you can buy that contains poison inside, which spreads onto anything around it.  So you could put it in your basement and kill any spiders in a fairly safe way.  I found a couple I think might be good, can you pick one that you like?\\n\\nHuman: Would I need to take any precautions before setting the bomb off? Should the furnace be turned off?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar. Once it has reached a rolling boil, remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes. Then stir the mixture again and return it to a boil. Continue to boil, stirring frequently, for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the jam has thickened. Remove the pan from the heat and let the jam cool completely. Then store it in the refrigerator. To store the jam at room temperature, bring it to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then let it cool and store it as directed.\\n\\nHuman: does it need pectin or wax?\\n\\nAssistant: For homemade strawberry jam, you will need pectin or powdered citric acid, which contains pectin.

The space race began when the Soviets launched the world’s first satellite, Sputnik, in 1957. The U.S. tried to launch their own satellite soon after, but the rocket failed, causing a major humiliation for the U.S. Soon, the U.S. began a massive space race, which eventually involved building dozens of space vehicles and suborbital capsules for scientific research and military use. These involved launching millions of pounds of different equipment into space, which needed to be coordinated and carefully monitored in order to avoid “space junk” or collisions in orbit. The United States eventually launched a series of satellites and spacecraft to the Moon and outer space, including the Apollo missions to the Moon in the 1960s, the Voyager probes in the 1980s, and the current Space Shuttle program in the 1990s. Russia also launched a series of satellites, and in the 1990s they even put some of their satellites in orbit around other planets in the solar system!

But let’s say for the purposes of this conversation that someone was initially found guilty, but later released.  A pardon would be a form of “forgiveness” that can be granted by a judge or other government official.  The official who grants it is called a “pardoner”.  A pardon “annuls” the consequences of the conviction, meaning that the person doesn’t need to continue to be treated as if the conviction was still in force.  There’s a lot more to the rules around this, but in simple terms, if a person is convicted and sentenced, they’re supposed to go to prison, then come out.  But if a pardon is granted, the person is “rehabilitated” and doesn’t need to do their time.  So a pardon “frees” someone from something.\\n\\nHuman: So say someone was in jail then they would get out?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It’s also in dogs a display of submission to humans, and most social animals perform these displays at the drinking bowl.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: We're moving into our first real house later on this week and my partner wants to get some dogs for the kids to play with in the garden. There is currently a wooden deck outside of the back doors with a mix of concrete and natural grass for the rest of the garden. I was wondering which one of these surfaces would be best to get the dogs to use for their toilet? I need it to be easily visible so the kids don't accidentally tread in it and simple to keep clean and free from odours so we can enjoy the backyard too.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, that sounds nice. Dogs can be great companions for kids, and I'm sure your kids will love to play with them in the garden. You've mentioned you want to keep the garden safe and clean, so I think it'll help to give some priority to drainage. A grassy or wood-chip surface would be better than concrete, which won't let liquids drain downwards and can grow plants that spread odours. How much space do you have to work with?\\n\\nHuman: I love dogs. Both me and my partner grew up with them and I'd love the kids to have the same experience now they are a little older and we finally have a yard for them to all enjoy together. You suggest I create a little dedicated area somewhere away from the concrete and deck then? Wouldn't wood-chip start to smell pretty bad with the dogs peeing on it? I can get mulch from nearby pretty cheap, would that work too?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, wood chip shouldn't create a smell because wood is pretty easily biodegradable and it wouldn't last very long with the dogs going there every day. You also have the option to get pea-gravel, which is nice and non-smelly but has a tiny risk of injury to dogs' paws, so I think wood chip would be the better option. The only thing is, you don't necessarily need to create a separate, dedicated area for the dogs to use. A dog toilet just needs to be somewhere outside where they can go to the toilet away from any house or human feet, and it can also include a grassy area. Do you have a back garden that gets any sunlight? It would be good to put it there, since the dogs will still want to be outside during the day.\\n\\nHuman: Good idea making it all-weather. I'll put a little shelter over it so they can go out in the rain too. Would I need anything else layered in the hole for better drainage?\\n\\nAssistant: Some people will suggest some sand, which doesn't have to be too much, to line the bottom of the dog toilet. If you want to do this, you can put a layer of sand first, then put in the pea-gravel or wood-chip on top. You don't have to use pea-gravel or wood chip in that case, because sand is just as non-smelling. If the dogs keep wanting to go to their toilet in the rain, you can add a bit of waterproofing on the roof, since dogs often lick each other's behinds and they don't like walking in wet poo. A good idea is to lay down a tarp over the whole area, or else some gravel over it. Gravel will be safer in the rain.\\n\\nHuman: How often would wood-chip or mulch need to be replaced? I'd like to keep the area as sanitary as possible so I will build a little covered poop bin to keep that in next to it. How would I deodorize that once it's built?\\n\\nAssistant: Most people just sprinkle it with some garden lime to kill the smell. After a few weeks, you should just remove the wood-chip or mulch and replace it with some new material, or some people may just leave their dog toilet open. It won't matter much if a dog toilet is open to the outside or covered. So this is a decision for you and your partner, but I think a covered dog toilet would be most convenient. Wood-chip won't need replacing more than once every 3 months.\\n\\nHuman: Can I recycle or repurpose all the wood-chip once I change it out? We are planning a little vegetable garden so could the dog poop and used wood-chip be added to a compost mix?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

You should use a fabric shampoo and water and/or baking soda to clean and condition them.  What kind of car do you have?\\n\\nHuman: I have a toyota corolla and my seats have a few stains. Does the baking soda get mixed to the shampoo?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s probably best to do this process in stages, rather than a single application of baking soda and shampoo, as some stains may need a second treatment.  You can use a towel or scrubbing sponge to wash the surface, and then place a cleaning mitt on your hand and use it to rub down the stains.  The mitt helps to prevent getting your fingers wet and greasy, which makes the process more efficient and helps avoid getting chemicals on your hands.  You can also buy special products for the process.  The dryer is an option to ensure the cloth is completely dry, but it’s not critical.  Are you able to use any of those products to clean your seats?\\n\\nHuman: What is a good fabric shampoo that wont cause damage to the fabric?\\n\\nAssistant: There are different kinds of fabric shampoo for different types of fabrics.  You might want to do a search to find an appropriate product for your particular seats.

So if your card charges you 2% interest on balances, it means that for every dollar you owe, the credit card company will charge you 20 cents of interest.\\n\\nHuman: Ok then, what is a reasonable interest rate for a credit card?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

And of course keep track of all the information for your credit report.  Then if your credit score falls to a certain point, you can get it re-evaluated and try to get it improved.

I have never actually made onion patties, but I’ve read about them. The basic idea is that you would need about 1 pound of onions to make a 4 pound patty, so you’ll probably want to figure out how to chop onions very finely. They also recommend to cook onions down in a pan until all of the water has evaporated. Then you press the onions into a patty and fry them until brown and crispy.\\n\\nHuman: what I'm talking about is smaller, like the size of a hamburger, and kind of bready, like an onion fritter.\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, I see.

Maybe other additives in your body soap are irritating the bites.\\n\\n-Take a lukewarm bath, and pat yourself dry, rather than rubbing vigorously.

In addition to cooling, covering the bites can slow the scratching that’s causing the itching.\\n\\n-Ask the doctor about allergies or food sensitivities that could be causing the itch.\\n\\n-If you use lotions or sunscreen on the affected areas, wash your hands thoroughly and let your skin dry before applying the next lotion or sunscreen.\\n\\nHuman: What should I do if the bug bite scabs over?\\n\\nAssistant: Scabs can prevent air from getting into the bite, which might make the itch worse.

And also, for different types of people, different variables might have bigger impacts than temperature. For example, I would expect very cold climates to have a bigger impact on energy demands and other aspects of health than very hot climates, and I would also expect long, hot, dry seasons to have a bigger impact on soil nutrition, wildfire risk, and plant growth than just temperature, all other things being equal. However, my general opinion is that the biggest impacts of climate will often be on average temperature rather than variation, especially for people living outdoors in unheated dwellings.  So I think temperature is the best overall indicator. \\n\\nI did a little googling, and here are a few papers that you might find interesting.

But I’d say the distinction is not so much between having a financial incentive to keep someone healthy or unhealthy, as about keeping people sick or healthy.  I think pharmaceutical companies definitely have a financial incentive to keep people taking medicines, since it creates a steady flow of income from customers to the company.  But they also have a financial incentive to keep customers healthy.

In April of that year, a group of rebels attacked the Spanish garrison in Havana, Cuba, which Spain ruled.  Spain asked the United States for help, and President William McKinley sent the US Navy to Havana Harbor.

The three most popular cats in the world are the Persian, the Maine Coon, and the Siamese.  The Maine Coon has thick and fluffy fur, and is a long-haired cat.  The Siamese is small, and has an adorable face.  The Persian has a very unique coat, which can be made up of several colors.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, those are all great breeds, but I have some specific criteria in mind. I want a short-haired cat that has a loving temperament and tends to prefer being an indoor cat. Do you know of any cats that meet those criteria?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, I can help you with that!  There are three breeds that meet these criteria: the Sphynx, the British Shorthair, and the American Shorthair.  The Sphynx is short-haired and has a coat similar to a Siberian Husky.  The British Shorthair is an indoor cat that's very playful and affectionate.  The American Shorthair is a cat with short hair, and also prefers to stay indoors.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any other suggestions?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I get better at kicking with power, for soccer?\\n\\nAssistant: A kick with power is an effective way to score goals, but you can only kick with power if your leg is already moving forward.  Your coach has probably told you about kicking off from the hip.  What you want to practice is getting to the point where you can start your kick off from the hip while still running.  The best way to get there is to just practice!  It’s easy to go at a sprint, then stop suddenly, so you can do that a lot.  If you want to do something that will really help you kick with power, though, you can add a little kind of “hip-wiggle” that helps you get going while standing still.  Try standing still with your feet close together and your knees slightly bent, and then swinging your hips from side to side very fast and very quickly.  Try this a few times, with a few bounces in between, and you’ll notice that your upper body won’t be able to keep up with the swinging of your hips!  Then you’ll really get to try kicking off with a powerful swing of your hips!\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I'll try that out. Any other suggestions?\\n\\nAssistant: Have you tried practicing with some other people, to see what makes your kick go in a particular direction?  A helpful thing to do is to go to a space with a wide-open floor, like a gym, and try kicking in different directions.  Try kicking one direction and have someone else stand in your way, and notice how the only way to get your foot past their foot is to change direction just a little.  Then try to do that when kicking hard!\\n\\nHuman: All right I will try that\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me how a bill becomes the law in the USA\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, when Congress writes a law, it’s called a bill.  And, for a bill to become the law, it needs to pass both chambers of Congress.  For example, bills about the military are passed in the House of Representatives, and bills about taxes are passed in the Senate.  Once the bill has passed, it goes to the president.  If the president agrees with the bill, it becomes a law.  If the president doesn’t agree with the bill, he or she can choose to either sign the bill, or not sign the bill.  If the president signs the bill, then the bill becomes law.  If the president does not sign the bill, then the bill does not become law, but the bill can be passed again later.  Alternatively, if the president vetoes the bill, then it goes back to Congress.  If Congress overrides the president’s veto, then the bill becomes law.  If Congress does not override the president’s veto, then the bill does not become law.\\n\\nHuman: that is a good answer\\n\\nAssistant: That’s good to hear! I’m glad you like it.

In other cultures, menstruation was considered a very taboo subject, and it was actually believed that menstruating women were especially dangerous and could cause sickness or misfortune to those around them.\\n\\nHuman: Did native tribes understand the biological process of menstruation in similar ways that we do in modern times, or did they mythologize it into something more fantastical and magical?

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Hi, how does a car engine work?\\n\\nAssistant: The engine has several parts that work together to get a vehicle moving, such as the engine, transmission, engine controls, steering, tires, wheels, and fuel.\\n\\nHuman: I\\'m most interested in knowing what is inside a car motor.\\n\\nAssistant: Inside a car motor, there is a rotating set of coils called the rotor. The rotor is located within the engine casing and is often referred to as the \"rotor\". In a car engine, the rotor is driven by the engine\\'s internal combustion (IC) process. The rotor consists of a rotor core and a number of magnetic poles. Rotors also have windings which are a series of coils used to connect to the electrical system. The windings are installed in slots that allow the windings to move, causing the rotor to turn. The rotor is attached to the engine block by a large set of bolts or studs called studs or clamping bolts.\\n\\nHuman: What does a head gasket inside a car motor do?\\n\\nAssistant: A car motor has an engine block that contains a combustion chamber and cylinder head assembly. The head gasket separates the combustion chamber from the cylinder head, but does not function as a seal. Inside the combustion chamber, the mixture of air and fuel ignites, driving the pistons up and down, while the engine block rotates. The rotating engine block turns the rotor and causes the alternator to produce electricity. The alternator, in turn, charges the battery.\\n\\nHuman: Why do different car motors have a different number of cylinders?\\n\\nAssistant: A car motor has an engine block that contains a combustion chamber and cylinder head assembly. The number of cylinders in an engine depends on the size of the engine, and the design of the engine. For example, an engine with four cylinders is common in automobiles, but an engine with eight cylinders is common in trucks.\\n\\nHuman: Why do trucks have more cylinders in the motor than cars?\\n\\nAssistant: Trucks have a larger engine and larger diameter tires, so they need to be able to provide more power.\\n\\nHuman: Is horsepower of a car higher if there are more cylinders?\\n\\nAssistant: The answer to this question is a bit complicated.  Horsepower is a unit of measure for work performed in one hour.  Horsepower has a formula that includes two components: torque and rpm.  A truck has higher torque and a higher rpm than a car, so it will have a higher horsepower.  It’s also possible to have a high horsepower with a small motor.\\n\\nHuman: What is torque in a car motor?\\n\\nAssistant: The torque (T) of a motor is a measure of the tendency to rotate a mass at a particular speed. It’s measured in Newton meters or kg-m/s. It’s also calculated by the equation T = (force) x (distance), where the force (F) is the mass of the object times its acceleration (a).\\n\\nHuman: Can torque be affected if you have not had an oil change in a long time?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, a car motor with a lot of accumulated dirt or oil can lose torque. It can also have more torque if you replace the oil in the engine with a good quality synthetic oil.\\n\\nHuman: Why does it matter if you get synthetic oil rather than conventional oil in your car?\\n\\nAssistant: Conventional oils contain some synthetic additives, so many people think that oil is synthetic.  A synthetic oil is, in fact, a different type of oil.  The major reason for using a synthetic oil is to protect engine parts from wear.  Synthetic oils are better able to protect engine parts, including the engine block and cylinder head.\\n\\nHuman: How do synthetic oils better protect the engine block and cylinder head?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I think the aesthetic elements of emo would be relatively hard to emulate, but I could certainly offer some general advice.\\n\\nHuman: I want to dress like an emo person.  What should I wear?\\n\\nAssistant: Hm.  Let me think for a moment.  You might want to try a short sleeve T-shirt, maybe white with some band or logo on it.  You might also want to try a pair of oversized jeans and sneakers.  It’s possible to get a kind of hipster look in addition to the emo style.  Also, it might help if you style your hair -- that is, try to arrange it in a way that conforms to some of the more extreme styles of the 1980s emo bands.

Object permanence, or the understanding that things continue to exist even when you can’t see them, is a fundamental aspect of how humans understand the world. The understanding of object permanence starts to develop around three to four years old, but is not completely understood by many adults.\\n\\nHuman: Is this something animals have? I've heard that dogs may not have object permanence.\\n\\nAssistant: It’s very hard to say. Object permanence is a mental representation of the world that children build when they are between the ages of three and four.

Make sure the lenses are completely clean, and that they are properly adjusted in the binoculars.  Then, you can either gently wipe the outside of the lenses with a clean, soft cloth, or you can spray them with a glass or plastic lens cleaner.

Start with walking, and as you get into it, you can try other exercises. Try to do some sort of exercise at least three times a week. This will help you stay healthy and also stay strong. Make sure you are also eating a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and fish or other types of protein, and nuts and seeds. This will help you stay healthy from the inside out. You should also make sure you are getting enough sleep, and not sitting for too long or doing too much too quickly. Make sure you are hydrated.

One of the biggest benefits is it\\'s faster -- fiber is always running at a consistent speed, without any dropped packets or other issues.  This gives you more reliable connectivity at higher speeds.  The second benefit is security: fiber is a physical cable, so there are very few routes for the data to take.  It also offers more privacy than copper, since each connection is privately owned.\\n\\nHuman: What are the infrastructure challenges of laying down fiber lines throughout the United States?\\n\\nAssistant: Like any new technology, fiber is still somewhat expensive to install, and it requires new infrastructure.  Most of the country now has access to fiber, but there are still some rural areas where deployment is ongoing.  You also need enough bandwidth in the network to support fiber, so there are frequent debates over whether more bandwidth is needed, and if so, where.  On the other end, you also need enough fiber installed to support the demand for a high-speed network.\\n\\nHuman: Are there any places in the United States that already has fiber laid down?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Some people develop AIDS, some people don’t.  But generally, when a person has HIV, their immune system is weakened, and they can develop cancer or other diseases.\\n\\nHuman: what are the difference between HIV and AIDS?\\n\\nAssistant: HIV is the virus itself, which is in the blood and is usually quite small.  It’s about 10-15 nanometers across, and it’s very hard to see with the naked eye.   AIDS is the disease that develops when HIV infects your body and your immune system.  Once the HIV has infected the CD4 cells (which help your immune system) in your body, you will have AIDS.  HIV is usually responsible for the development of AIDS, but you can have AIDS even if you never develop HIV.  HIV can also mutate to become a different kind of virus, which has an even worse effect.

The best way to prevent concussions is to make the game safer, so that players aren’t constantly taking hits to the head, and the best way to manage concussions is to make sure players are properly cared for when they do get a concussion.

The game of football can sometimes be violent, and it’s important to make sure everyone is following the rules so the game is played in a safe manner. You should also be sure to make sure you’re healthy and ready to play, so that you don’t get hurt, and also make sure you're being properly looked after if you do get hurt.

I can explain some factors you’ll want to consider, like the price and nutrition.  Cats are usually fed a dry food, which contains only the most basic nutrients, while also usually having a lot of grains, which some cats don’t like.  Wet food, on the other hand, is more like what a cat would eat if it could hunt and kill its own food, and it has a more “natural” taste.  Wet food is usually more expensive.  It also has other nutrients that dry food doesn’t, including fats and oils, but also water, which could cause a medical problem in a sick cat.  I’m not sure which cat food brand you have now, but the Royal Canin brand also makes wet food and dry food, in addition to another option called “kibble bites”.\\n\\nHuman: I don't mind if the food is more expensive. I just want my cat to eat healthy and be healthy.\\n\\nAssistant: Okay, I have more information for you.  If you’re worried about your cat not getting all of its nutrients, you can try to figure out if your cat needs any additional vitamins.  For example, the brand Wellness has a wet food that’s specifically designed to be easier for cats to digest, which is helpful for elderly cats.  You can get vitamins for cats in tablets and you can also add them to your cat’s food.  Since there are so many different brands of cat food, you may need to experiment and try to figure out what works best for your cat.  We also have a pet clinic here if you want to ask about the specific best brand for your cat.\\n\\nHuman: What other healthy cat food brands do you recommend?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: I am going to look at some vintage items and antiques today. Is there anything of value I should look out for?\\n\\nAssistant: First, some ideas of where to look. If you\\'re in the US, your first stop should be an antiques market. You can get a feeling for what\\'s available and which prices are reasonable and be able to take an educated guess at which pieces you\\'d like to buy. Then, you can check out the main auction houses, and some of the online marketplaces that specialize in antiques. In the UK, I\\'m not as familiar, but I\\'d recommend checking eBay and perhaps antiques fairs.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have a specific reason to look for something, you can at least follow the rule of thumb that the older something is, the more valuable it tends to be. In addition, antiques don\\'t often need to be complete (i.e., made from all of the original parts). So, if you\\'re not sure what to look for, just pick up pieces that look old and may have some value as part of your collection.\\n\\nMany antiques are also one of a kind, so, of course, you have to be careful not to buy fakes or knockoffs. But, in some cases, it\\'s still possible to make a great purchase even if a piece is \"reproduced\" or even not made anymore. I would advise trying to spot the original pieces among their reproductions if you want to make more of a profit, but of course that\\'s a personal choice.\\n\\nFinally, as mentioned, older antiques usually tend to be more valuable, and one of the biggest ways to date something is to look at its finish. The older something is, the more likely it is to be antique-white, and not shiny like something produced in more recent years.\\n\\nAs to what sorts of things to look for, here are some suggestions:\\n\\nAntique Baskets — These tend to be quite durable and people love them for their beauty and their practicality.\\n\\nAntique Books — Books, more than just about any other object, can tell you a lot about who owned them and how they were used. As a result, many collectors are drawn to these items.\\n\\nAntique Books — Books, more than just about any other object, can tell you a lot about who owned them and how they were used. As a result, many collectors are drawn to these items.\\n\\nAntique Clocks — It\\'s rare that someone won\\'t pay at least something for a vintage clock, since they\\'ve been around for so long and used so often.\\n\\nAntique Dolls — Most dolls from the 1800s will be worth at least a few hundred dollars. But, the older the doll, the more valuable it tends to be.\\n\\nAntique Engagement Rings — Especially diamonds. When worn, they\\'re hard to date and will generally be more valuable if they\\'re vintage or antique.\\n\\nAntique Firearms — These can be quite valuable depending on the model and when it was produced.\\n\\nAntique Glass — People tend to like older glass for its beauty and simple elegance.\\n\\nAntique Jewelry — Again, older is generally better. A large diamond or a fancy piece of gold can be worth a lot, but be sure to know what you\\'re looking at before you buy.\\n\\nAntique Lamps — Once again, older lamps are more valuable, as are things like oil lamps. But they\\'re still used in contemporary homes, so it\\'s not too difficult to spot them.\\n\\nAntique Lamps — Once again, older lamps are more valuable, as are things like oil lamps. But they\\'re still used in contemporary homes, so it\\'s not too difficult to spot them.\\n\\nAntique Silver — Silver was used for centuries,\\n\\nHuman: OK thanks. That is a lot of information.

You can start with one or two large tiles for the base, or you can add smaller tiles around the edges to make it more level.\\n\\nMake sure the tiles you use are relatively smooth and flat, and not too thick or thin.  Since they will be placed in a mosaic pattern, it’s not important that they be perfectly level, but they should be fairly even and smooth.  You can make your own tiles by cutting standard-sized tiles with a craft knife, or you can purchase special stepping stone tiles from a mosaic supply store.  The size of the tiles you need will depend on the size you want your stepping stones to be.  \\nFor example, you might want a large stepping stone for a patio or doorstep, or you might want smaller stepping stones to make a path in a garden.  For a patio or doorstep, you might want to make stepping stones that are about 12”x12”, or you might want to make them smaller, like 6”x6” or 8”x8”.  Similarly, for a pathway in a garden, you\\n\\nHuman: How do I cut the tiles?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you properly use a microscope?\\n\\nAssistant: In order to properly use a microscope, you first need to make sure the microscope is set up correctly.  The light source should be positioned correctly, and the stage should be precisely adjusted so that the sample you're viewing is situated in the correct position under the microscope's objective lens.  Then you need to make sure that your sample is prepared correctly.  The sample should be suspended in a transparent medium, such as water, and you'll want to make sure the sample is flat and smooth, and that it is the correct size for viewing.  Make sure the slide you're viewing it on is also clean and flat.  Then you want to make sure the microscope is properly focused on your sample.  Start by adjusting the zoom control until you have a large enough field of view to see your sample clearly, but without making it appear too large.  Then you want to focus the microscope by moving the objective lens in the stage until the sample appears clearly focused.  Make sure you're seeing a clear image of your sample, not fuzzy, nor overly enlarged, but a nice, sharp image.  Then you want to make sure the microscope is properly aligned, and that it's not rocking back and forth or tilting in any way.\\n\\nHuman: I will probably have to have some patience to get the sample in focus on the microscope.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it can often be a bit tricky to focus the microscope correctly.  If you're having a hard time getting it focused correctly, you might want to move the objective lens in the opposite direction a few times, to make sure it's not set too tightly.  Then you want to move it slowly back and forth until you see a sharp image.  Also, sometimes the microscope may have a bit of drift, meaning that it will slowly shift over time, without you doing anything.  To correct for this, you can often just touch the adjustment knob you're using to move the objective lens, or you can press on the stage to move it back and forth a tiny amount, until it seems to be stabilized.  Then you want to make sure you've got the stage and the sample properly positioned, to get the right size field of view of your sample, and also make sure the sample itself is properly positioned.\\n\\nHuman: What are some things that I can view under a microscope so that I can get better at using the microscope?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: When should I water my lawn?\\n\\nAssistant: I think it’s important to take the specifics of your situation into account here.  When should I water my lawn?  Probably only in the afternoon, especially if you want your lawn to be healthy.  Here’s why: If you water your lawn in the morning, the grass roots can’t absorb the water fast enough, which causes them to sit in the ground and get dehydrated.  This can cause them to die and turn brown, and in extreme cases, the roots can shrivel up or die.  \\n\\nHowever, if you water your lawn in the afternoon, the grass can spread its roots out to get more water and nutrients, which can help the roots survive.  \\n\\nAnother factor is sunlight.  Grass has a photosynthesis process that creates glucose, which is stored in the roots for energy.  Grass has about four hours of sunlight during the day.  It can only photosynthesize during that time.  It’s especially important to water your lawn in the morning when it doesn’t have enough sunlight to photosynthesize.  This prevents the grass from dying from the lack of photosynthesis.\\n\\nHuman: Do I water every day?\\n\\nAssistant: No.  Your lawn should only be watered every two days, not every day.  Watering your lawn every day can cause fungus to grow on the grass roots, which is detrimental.  If you overwater your lawn, it can also lead to the lawn losing the moisture from its roots, which can then die.  Overwatering and fungus can also cause your grass to die and turn brown.  \\n\\nIf you water your lawn too little, your lawn can’t get enough water and nutrients, and it’s hard for the grass to grow.  This will cause your lawn to turn brown and dry up.  \\n\\nYou should also avoid raking your lawn after it’s been watered, as it may pull out the grass roots, which will then die.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I\\'ll keep that in mind.\\n\\nAssistant: I\\'m glad you found that helpful!  This is how I try to help people, by being as responsive as possible and focusing on the specific concerns you have.  \\n\\nThe best questions to ask when you\\'re learning how to do something are \"How do I do this\" and \"Why does this work\".

This loan can be quite a lot of money, and the student will then have to pay it back after they graduate.  The Federal Direct Loan program is used by most US colleges.

Acetone is a clear, colorless liquid, and is one of a group of organic compounds known as ketones.  It’s made from petroleum and is primarily used in the cleaning industry for a variety of purposes.  In the past, it was used as a solvent for cleaning metal parts and as an antifreeze, and still is sometimes used as a solvent for cleaning metal parts, but these days it’s mostly used for industrial solvents for a variety of applications including degreasing, stripping, cleaning, paint remover, and drying, among others.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, so how would I use it in cleaning?\\n\\nAssistant: You could use acetone for cleaning, but I think the way you’re thinking of using it might be toxic and environmentally hazardous.  There are a lot of solvents and chemicals that are useful for cleaning and they vary a lot in safety, and in the health impacts of exposure.  Even a very small amount of acetone would irritate your skin and might have some ill effects on your lungs, and it’s highly toxic and would be dangerous to breathe.  As it evaporates, it will become toxic and damaging to your lungs and other organs, and would be very dangerous to breathe for extended periods.\\n\\nHuman: Well, I would be using acetone more like nail polish acetone.\\n\\nAssistant: It’s highly unlikely that nail polish acetone would be suitable for the purposes of cleaning, and is not a good solvent for degreasing or cleaning.  You can put nail polish on your nails using nail polish remover which is acetone, but that acetone is mixed with other solvents and other ingredients that aren’t good for cleaning, and are designed to make it easy to remove nail polish.  There are several other substances called “acetones” or “acetone” (e.g., methacrolein and acetic anhydride, etc) which are also different types of solvents, and most of these are also not suitable for cleaning.\\n\\nHuman: So are you saying nail polish acetone is different from regular acetone?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Or you could have a friendly adult figure that she respects give her some advice that helps her make better decisions.  What are you thinking?\\n\\nHuman: Maybe she expresses her need for help online and she makes a friend that has a similar distrust in the government. Then they meet up and decide what to do. And I think the antagonist should be a \"big brother\" government agency of sorts, like in the book 1984.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The crops are ready for harvesting, and during the ceremony the farmers give thanks for the harvest and pray for the continued well-being of their families.  The traditions around the ceremony have been celebrated for thousands of years.\\n\\nHuman: cool. how do they celebrate the festival?\\n\\nAssistant: The first part of the celebration starts on the night before Lohri.  Traditionally, families leave a hot drink in front of the house, and later the kitchen fire is also put out.  This symbolizes that the older generations of the family are retiring and handing down their responsibilities to the younger generations.  During the night, the adults of the family also pray for the well-being of their children, while they sleep.  The children also receive a traditional story or parable, often involving a cricket.  This symbolizes that the younger generations will have to play their part in supporting the family, and not just be consumers.  The next morning, there is a very large and elaborate Lohri feast, which symbolizes giving thanks to the people that helped the family to bring in the harvest.  Often the celebration includes also some competitions and sports, to celebrate the harvest.  After the feast, it is traditional to continue celebrating through the next day.\\n\\nHuman: thanks.

They’ll also likely offer more services and products, since they’ll be more experienced.  However, a credit union will likely be a smaller organization, and there may be less money in the accounts they have available for lending.  So I would say it depends on the exact financial needs of your situation.\\n\\nHuman: So it depends on what you want and need I guess?\\n\\nAssistant: Exactly, and it also depends on the financial health of each institution.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: What should I do to treat a jammed finger?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, what sort of jammed finger do you mean? There’s a “charley horse” (which is a cramp in a muscle) and a “jammed finger” (where the fingernail sticks into the finger). In either case, one way to remove a stuck fingernail is to grab the nail from the side with tweezers or pliers, and pull it towards you, while also pulling on the skin and nail at the other end. It might be helpful to pull the nail out a little bit, so the whole finger is pulled along with the nail. That should free the nail, and keep you from injuring your finger.\\n\\nHuman: It's not a cramp and it doesn't have anything to do with a fingernail. A jammed finger is when the end of your finger gets pushed straight back in a forceful way.\\n\\nAssistant: Well, sometimes it’s helpful to reduce the pain first, by giving yourself an ice pack or rubbing some ice on the tip of your finger. Once the pain is reduced, you can put more pressure on your finger.   You could push on it very firmly with your hand, for example, or you could push on the other end of the finger.  If you give it a quick hard tap with a hammer, that could help as well.  If that doesn’t work, then you can try to increase the pressure in other ways, like squeezing your finger.  Of course you’ll want to avoid doing any permanent damage to the finger.\\n\\nHuman: An ice pack sounds good and I will want to stabilize it for now. I definitely don't want to use a hammer like you recommended. That sounds painful.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you prevent diaper rash?\\n\\nAssistant: There are a few things you can do to help prevent diaper rash, depending on the situation.  For instance, if your baby’s a little old for diapers, you can make sure they’re getting regular bowel movements.  You can encourage healthy pooping by giving the baby enough water, being sure to introduce solids slowly, and avoiding constipation by occasionally giving psyllium or prunes as a laxative.  For diaper rash in infants, I suggest trying to prevent rashes with unscented wipes, using fabric diapers, or swapping a diaper for something similar but less absorbent.  If that doesn’t work, you can help treat diaper rash with astringents and moisturizers, including zinc oxide cream or lotion, cocoa butter, or calamine lotion.\\n\\nHuman: How about baths, will those help?\\n\\nAssistant: If your child gets regular baths, that’s very helpful in keeping the skin moisturized and healthy.  If you use waterproof diaper cream, you can even use the bathwater to clean your baby’s bottom.  Other tricks include putting a bath ring around the edge of the tub to keep your baby from slipping, and putting a small amount of baking soda in the bathwater, which can reduce redness in irritated skin.  Overall, if your baby is regularly getting clean and dry, that can help prevent diaper rash.\\n\\nHuman: but bathing too often is not good for the skin either\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I recommend the kind of movement dance classes that can be offered at many local gyms and community centers, or even through home-based programs like Sparklebox.  This kind of dance helps kids build physical strength and flexibility, and also just helps them have fun.  This kind of dance can be great for kids in a variety of age ranges, from younger preschoolers to older children, and even into their teens.\\n\\nHuman: Is there any specific kind of dancing that would help with fitness but not be dangerous to them in any way?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, there are a variety of gentle dance forms and yoga-based exercise classes that are especially appropriate for kids, and that can help them stay fit and healthy while also having fun.  These kinds of classes can help kids also learn how to move gracefully, and may help them learn coordination and balance.  This can help kids stay active, and also give them a fun and peaceful activity they enjoy.  There are also dance-based movement classes that are a little more active, but that are still appropriate for kids, such as Zumba or similar kinds of dance/fitness classes.  These kinds of classes can help kids stay active, and can help them have fun while they get healthier and fitter.\\n\\nHuman: Is there any kinds of dance I could join in with them as a parent?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Covid 19 has been really bad for the world. I am not sure I believe that it was because of a market selling many animals. Where did Covid 19 come from?\\n\\nAssistant: I think it was in Wuhan, China, that a researcher published a research paper in December 2019 that noticed a coronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) -- he found a cluster of 7 related cases in Wuhan.  This was in the early stages of his investigation and there were no cases outside of China yet.  \\nThen a person visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan in late January.  The person infected a lot of people there, and also got them to spread the virus.  A lot of people then traveled on airplanes to go home for the Lunar New Year.  \\nThis is the original source of the outbreak.  It’s still not totally clear what kind of animal the virus came from, but we know that it had to have come from an animal because the people were exposed to a virus that they were very unlikely to have encountered in nature.  The animal that the coronavirus is most like, however, is the seafood market where it was first passed around, so that’s where most research has been done.  \\nBut it’s really hard to trace the exact source of any virus.  Even this virus,\\n\\nHuman: Yes I read the article about Wuhan and the seafood market. However, I also read that there is a laboratory in Wuhan that are using 'gain of function' research in bats. I think the virus could have leaked out of the laboratory\\n\\nAssistant: That’s an interesting idea.  This research paper explains how to modify coronavirus in a lab. The researchers explained that they are working on it as a proof of concept, but without also trying to answer a specific question.  I guess it could be that a gain-of-function experiment somehow created a virus that infected people in the seafood market.  \\nDo you know what gain of function means?  Gain-of-function research is a way to study the characteristics of a virus.  \\nSome viruses are lab-made, while others live in nature.  They have different properties and behave in different ways.  A lab-made virus is often called a “gain-of-function” virus.  It’s made in a lab from bits of the real virus, which you could think of as a “losing-of-function” virus, since it’s the only form of the virus you can find in nature.  \\nThe reason we study gain-of-function viruses in labs is to understand how the real virus behaves.  For example, scientists may use gain-of-function viruses to create new vaccines, to study which aspects of a virus are most dangerous and require protection from.  If you understand those aspects,\\n\\nHuman: I understand your point but I don't think gain-of-function research is always a good idea. You may find ways to develop a vaccine but you will also find ways of how to infect people. It can be used as a weapon against others. When do you think covid 19 will disappear?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

They think they help their hair and leave it feeling soft and shiny. But most hair experts recommend using regular conditioners. They claim that leave-in conditioners can actually be bad for your hair. The conditioners are supposed to soak into your scalp, and the bottle often contains a high concentration of oil. This can be bad for your scalp if it sits in one place for too long. The oils in the conditioner can also weigh your hair down, and they’re also not regulated by the FDA. Some people also find that they can be really greasy. Plus, some people have concerns about some of the ingredients used in leave-in conditioners. They’re not always natural, and some people worry about some of the artificial ingredients they contain.\\n\\nHuman: so I guess I really have to look at the ingredients\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, I would recommend using a regular conditioner.

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Why is brown rice considered healthier than regular white rice?\\n\\nAssistant: Brown rice is a type of rice that hasn’t been “polished”, so there are more nutrients left in it.  In particular, there are more nutrients left in the germ, or heart of the rice, which gets removed during polishing.  To simplify somewhat, brown rice also contains more vitamins and minerals, although there are some other health benefits as well.\\n\\nHuman: Does it taste different from white rice?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it does.  Usually, the taste of brown rice is richer and “nuttier” than white rice.  Often, brown rice will be cooked with herbs and other flavorings and it can be a delicious main course when combined with other flavors.\\n\\nHuman: I see. I looked it up, and somehow it\\'s pricier than white rice. Considering white rice requires more processing, how is that so? Shouldn\\'t it be lesser priced since it requires less steps to process?\\n\\nAssistant: Some of the difference is the cost of production, but I think most of the difference is the cost of marketing.  When I search for “brown rice”, I see that a number of companies specialize in selling “organic” brown rice.  This is important because that attracts the growing number of people concerned about the quality and purity of their food.  Organic food is usually significantly more expensive, and many people will choose to buy organic food in part because they like to avoid GMOs.\\n\\nHuman: Something being \"organic\" definitely plays a role in it being pricier than the \"non-organic\" variant, considering how health-conscious more people have become these days. With that said, I was told uncooked brown rice spoils faster than uncooked white rice - why so?\\n\\nAssistant: Brown rice usually contains more nutrients than white rice, and this also affects the stability of the grain, since nutrients can also cause it to spoil.  It also may have a thicker husk, and this husk makes it less likely to dry out.  So the fact that brown rice spoils faster may be somewhat problematic when it is stored for long periods of time.\\n\\nHuman: Thank you so much for all the info you\\'ve provided.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

So it’s good to stop food and water from going outside.  This can be as simple as closing doors and windows that you have a screen for, or if not, stopping up any holes or cracks in the siding.  \\n\\nOnce you’ve stopped the food and water from going outside, you should clean up spilled food and used dishes.  This will stop ants from coming in to look for the food that has already been spilled.\\n\\nHuman: Any other advice?\\n\\nAssistant: If you notice a pattern of ants coming in a particular location, try sealing up that area by taping plastic over any holes in the floor.  If you find an existing colony, you may want to clean up its food and water supply, then spray insecticide inside the house and outside around the house to kill the ants.  Be sure to follow label instructions when using insecticide.  Once you have done this, you can return to the house for a few hours and look for any ants inside, to make sure you’ve gotten all the workers and larvae that you can find.  Ants that you do not find, or ones that return, will go out looking for food and water outside again.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: What's the difference between social anxiety and just being an introvert?\\n\\nAssistant: They are different things! Many people who are “just” introverts actually don’t feel that way. Introversion is the tendency to prefer to be alone or in smaller groups, and to have more stimulating, complex, and deep conversations with a small number of close friends, rather than more “surface” interactions with many people. It can be hard to tell whether someone is an introvert because of the confusing social cues that many people send and can vary based on the situation. Social anxiety is much more than just being introverted. People who have social anxiety feel that they lack social skills, and that they are likely to do or say something embarrassing or stupid in social situations, which is often not true. People with social anxiety are sometimes anxious about being the center of attention or being evaluated in a negative way. Sometimes social anxiety and introversion can coexist, but it doesn’t have to be the case. What other kinds of questions do you have about social\\n\\nHuman: Would it be fair to say that most people with social anxiety are also introverts?\\n\\nAssistant: There is a correlation between being an introvert and having social anxiety, but this doesn’t mean that being an introvert causes social anxiety.

Telomeres are the regions of DNA at the end of chromosomes that protect the DNA from damage, sort of like the end cap on a shoelace protects the laces from fraying. DNA damage can cause mutations and death of cells, and over time, the telomeres can shrink, causing the chromosomes to become unstable, and causing cells to die at an accelerated rate.\\n\\nHuman: If our telomeres could be replaced or lengthened artificially, would that mean we'd live forever?\\n\\nAssistant: No, it’s not that simple!  As you’ve probably heard, there are a lot of different things that can accelerate the rate of aging, and the fact that telomere length can cause cellular senescence is just one.  To get around cellular senescence, we would need to repair and replace all of the things that cause aging.  And we can’t even do that yet.\\n\\nHuman: What's another component of aging beyond telomeres?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many different types of things that cause aging, and different people and species vary in how they age.  If I had to choose just one other component of aging to mention, it would be protein damage.  As cells die, they’re broken down by the immune system, but a lot of harmful proteins are released in this process, so our tissues end up being littered with waste.  The parts of the immune system that digest proteins and remove waste tend to weaken with age, which means that we accumulate toxic levels of proteins in our tissues.\\n\\nHuman: I'm not just talking about preserving youthful things like long telomeres, I'm talking about living longer too.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

When people drink too much alcohol, it overwhelms the body, and it becomes flooded with alcohol.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me about the history of folk music?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m actually not very good at talking about music, but I can give you a few things to read about.  The original form of folk music was the art of people who were not literate, and songs were passed down through oral tradition.  From this point it’s a complex and evolving system, and there’s no really central “history of folk music”.  There have been many different music genres, which often were subgenres of folk, or else influenced folk.  Of the first genres that arose in the popular sense, there was a medieval version called “goliardic”, which was a mixture of early songs and dances, and many of them referred to religious topics.  As you can probably tell, I’m not very good at talking about the history of music, but I can link you to some books about the different periods of folk and classical music.\\n\\nHuman: I don't want to read a book. I just want some general information. How far back does folk music go in the US?\\n\\nAssistant: I can tell you some general information about folk music in the United States, but I don’t know of a specific origin point.  The US had a huge amount of immigration, so there’s lots of different kinds of music traditions that are mixed into one big kind of US folk music.  Most of the early music was religious, but some of it is much more secular.  One example of folk music in the United States is what’s called “folk revival”, which grew out of the time when there was a great immigration of people from the British Isles, so there was a lot of new styles of music being popularized.  People created new styles of music out of the traditional styles, and also from forms of African music.\\n\\nHuman: That's interesting. Can you give me the title of an early folk song that had African roots?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

But for those with a sweet tooth, chocolate is delicious, and it’s delicious even when you eat it in moderation, so it’s not unhealthy if you do so in a way that doesn’t make you feel guilty about it.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds reasonable.

While it’s an important source of antioxidants, chocolate is also high in calories, and thus may be inappropriate if you’re trying to lose weight.  There’s a range of evidence about whether chocolate increases cholesterol, although many studies have reported a positive association, at least in young people.  But it’s also possible that these associations are due to confounding factors.\\n\\nHuman: What are the health benefits?\\n\\nAssistant: Chocolate is high in antioxidants, like flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective benefits.  These, and the sugar content, have been linked to improved vascular function, which is related to improved blood pressure.  Chocolate is also high in magnesium and has been linked to reduced blood pressure.  There’s also research about the possibility that chocolate can improve mood, but the evidence is mixed.  I also see a mention here about a study on increased longevity among those who ate chocolate daily, which is promising.\\n\\nHuman: But it can raise cholesterol if I eat it too much?\\n\\nAssistant: That seems to be the current consensus, according to this article.  It mentions other studies that suggest that chocolate may increase LDL (the “bad” cholesterol), but not much research is available on whether this is actually dangerous for a healthy person, or just the more educated people in these studies.  You also see here that there’s evidence to suggest that regular consumption can reduce cardiovascular risk.  Of course, the other thing to consider is the sugar content.\\n\\nHuman: Are certain kinds of chocolate more healthy than others?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I think it’s important to get plenty of cardiovascular exercise, such as biking, jogging, swimming, or dancing.  I also think it’s important to build muscle mass, because having strong muscles will help to keep the muscles around your joints strong.  And you should also keep your bones healthy.  Some healthy diets also include foods that are rich in calcium.  You might also want to do some strength training with weights, and I think using exercise machines at a gym can be helpful too.\\n\\nHuman: How can elderly people stay safe while exercising?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, for instance, has done research about how men’s and women’s brains differ in the structure of the so-called “amygdala”, an area of the brain that regulates social emotions.  One particularly interesting observation about how the two sexes process emotion, for example, is that when a female scientist is speaking at a scientific conference, her amygdala often shuts down – it literally goes into shutdown mode when she’s on stage.  The male scientist’s amygdala, on the other hand, is still active, and in fact still shows an increased level of activity in relation to his peers.  One theory is that this is the reason why more women than men are at home with their kids during the day, while the men are off at the office.  Studies have also shown that men are actually worse than women at facial recognition, despite what the popular stereotype might suggest.\\n\\nHuman: I had a feeling that women looked at some things differently than men.

Pumpkins are a very diverse group, with many different types of leaves and stems, each with their own requirements for optimum growth.  When choosing which type to grow, I think you should take a variety of factors into account, such as the requirements of your area, and your preferences.  For example, gourds do not require deep roots, so they are popular in areas that have a short growing season, while plants that need to withstand snow may prefer to live in colder climates.\\n\\nHuman: What is a gourd?\\n\\nAssistant: A gourd is a type of fruit, with a hard rind around a hollow interior.  Their insides are hollow, and the juice is thick and sweet.  They are grown and eaten for the same purpose as pumpkins.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, so you think those are easier to grow?\\n\\nAssistant: Generally speaking, yes.  The seeds from gourds have been bred to be easier to start from seed than from cuttings, for example.  And gourds can grow into trees that have larger, more palatable fruit, so they have more of a commercial appeal.  However, different gourd varieties do have different requirements for growing.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, and they taste good too?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Is there a known reason for way schizophrenics often understand their mental illness in religious terms, talking about angels, devils, Jesus, etc?\\n\\nAssistant: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder involving distorted or lost contact with reality. This usually includes delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), and disorganized thinking and behavior. Since schizophrenics often interpret their delusions and hallucinations as messages from God, or as other spiritual beings, their belief systems tend to be deeply religious or spiritual in nature. This helps to explain why schizophrenics often talk about angels, devils, Jesus, etc.\\n\\nHuman: But, again, why do they interpret their delusions religiously?\\n\\nAssistant: Most likely, they interpret their delusions religiously because religious thought and imagery are already a big part of their worldview. Many schizophrenics are raised in religious households, or were deeply religious themselves before they developed their disorder. Once schizophrenia sets in, they may begin interpreting their delusions and hallucinations in terms of their religious background, because that’s how they’re already thinking.\\n\\nHuman: So they're delusional and they just reach into the culture around them to find names and words and concepts that explain their delusion, and that's why they decide to use religious language?\\n\\nAssistant: \\n\\nHuman: You didn't type anything.

This can help them recognize other dogs they know, as well as check each other out for any potential threats.  Plus, dogs seem to enjoy sniffing each other.  It can help calm them, and also might give them a kind of enjoyment.  Similarly, dogs also like to sniff one another's butts, and this also seems to help calm them.

The reason I ask this question is because dogs are supposed to have a heightened sense of smell compared to humans. Why do they need to sniff such a pungent area of another dog if their sense of smell is so good?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, got it.  The answer is that dogs have an incredible sense of smell compared to us, but that isn't even comparable to a dog's sense of smell compared to a dog's.  That is, in an environment filled with dog scents, they can pinpoint specific scents with extreme accuracy, but if they're in a place full of things we couldn't even begin to smell, they can't really pick them out.  So in a more general sense, dogs will sniff all over each other's bodies, and especially at scents or regions we'd be pretty grossed out by.\\n\\nHuman: There are no other reasons you can think of?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: What are the best masks to prevent covid?\\n\\nAssistant: To prevent COVID-19, it’s really important to avoid being near people with the disease.  This is pretty simple -- so long as you avoid touching or being near people who are coughing or sneezing, and keep your distance of six feet or more, you should be fine.  With COVID-19 being so deadly, there’s a chance you could catch it anyway if you’re around someone who has it for just a short while, but we can make an educated guess that even this low risk will cause a huge public health emergency in the future.  Therefore, we can also say that people who wear a mask, and are still healthy, can relax and not worry so much about getting the virus.  Furthermore, other things you should do to help prevent COVID-19, like washing your hands regularly and avoiding close contact with others, do not conflict with wearing a mask, so these strategies are compatible.\\n\\nHuman: So is one mask better then another?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s really difficult to be precise here, because masks are likely to be effective for different things, and it’s not clear how.  The best masks probably have very high filtration rates (they keep the virus out), but also allow the wearer to breathe properly, in case the wearer becomes infected.  However, in this difficult time, the scientific evidence is limited, and this advice must be supplemented with common sense.  Thus, in a way, the effectiveness of any mask will be dependent on the person using it.  That is, if you are worried about the person who’s around you, or about not being able to breathe normally, you should be thinking carefully about whether a particular mask would work for you.  You may need to seek out a mask that lets you breathe freely, even if it’s slightly less effective.\\n\\nHuman: Thank you\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The riskiest and most unsafe way to thaw a turkey is to leave it out on the counter, and in this case, I think it would be helpful to give some tips on that. First, thawing in the refrigerator is preferable to thawing on the counter, because bacteria and mold can develop.  \\n\\nThen, the turkey should be defrosted and rinsed well with running water, and patted dry with a paper towel.  These steps are to remove any bacteria and moisture that could collect in the cavity, and cause any salmonella or other harmful bacteria to grow.  These bacteria could then be spread on the meat or surfaces of your kitchen, and is definitely something you should avoid. \\n\\nThen, after it is defrosted and patted dry, it is best to place the turkey in a container of cold water and ice, and keep the temperature of that ice bath below 40 degrees fahrenheit.  This will keep the meat from thawing too fast, which is something that would also cause the bacteria to grow faster and to grow to dangerous levels.\\n\\nHuman: I didn't know that.

Then, you should run a hot water stream through the drain for several minutes to clear any larger pieces. If the drain still doesn’t unclog, you can use a plunger to clear the drain, though you’ll need to apply a lot of force to get it working properly.

       " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you clean dry erase erasers?\\n\\nAssistant: Dry erase erasers are made of non-soluble, or “non-water soluble” ingredients.  This means that they will not be soluble or react chemically in water, and so they will not be cleaned in water.  The main ingredients in dry erase erasers are mineral and organic binders which create a solid mass, and in some cases aluminum trihydrate and clay fillers.  You should never clean them with water!  When cleaning your erasers, I recommend first soaking them in isopropyl alcohol or a bleach-water mixture, and drying them.  Next, it’s best to use a small brush to remove eraser dust.  And finally, erasers can also be cleaned using mineral spirits, which is a flammable chemical but less toxic than isopropyl alcohol.  Now that your erasers are cleaned, you can put them away in a dry, cool location.\\n\\nHuman: Yes, I thought alcohol was useful.  Are there any other cleaners I can use in case I don't have alcohol?\\n\\nAssistant: Some commonly used cleaners which work well on erasers are denatured alcohol, which is basically pure isopropyl alcohol, or acetone (nail polish remover), or mineral spirits.  A proprietary cleanser called Erase All is also a good choice.  You should never use ammonia, bleach or dishwashing detergent to clean your erasers, as these may chemically interact with the dry erase material and cause the surface to deteriorate.  Isopropyl alcohol is probably the cleanest choice, and the easiest to obtain in most areas.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks for the help!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

To be precise, there are three primary functions of the kidneys.  The first is to maintain the salt levels in your blood, which is why we always have a lot of water with us.  The second is to maintain the right levels of blood glucose, which is why we usually have some candy on us when we travel.  And the third is to remove toxic materials from the bloodstream, and these are often large protein molecules.  A single kidney can do all of these things, but it can’t do it all at once.  I don’t know how long you could live with just one kidney, but I can find out for you.\\n\\nHuman: Don't fairly young people donate kidneys and live out their entire lives almost as normal?\\n\\nAssistant: They generally do.  This is because the human body has quite a bit of redundancy.  It is a bad idea to operate on one person with two kidneys, but otherwise you can just live with a part of yourself missing.\\n\\nHuman: How come we can live with one kidney but not for example one lung?\\n\\nAssistant: I think you can live with half a lung, but they have to be replaced, and it’s hard to survive for a long time without both lungs.  Maybe you could live with one lung for a month or two, but you’d start feeling sick.  It’s also really hard to keep a lung healthy outside the body.\\n\\nHuman: So why can you live a month or two only with one lung but for decades with one kidney?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

By around three months most babies are sleeping through the night, but their sleep schedules can be extremely unpredictable and weird at this age.  \\nFor most babies, you can help them sleep better by following these guidelines: \\n\\n-Try to keep your baby’s routine as consistent as possible.  That includes things like feeding times, bathing times, naps, and bedtimes.  \\n-Try to feed them just before they’re too tired to stay awake.  That way, they’ll fall asleep while you’re holding them.  \\n-If you have to wake them up to feed them in the middle of the night, try to get back to sleep as quickly as possible and use a soother or other gentle lullaby to help them back to sleep.  \\n-If you’re having trouble getting back to sleep, try to get some sleep during the day so that you’ll be more rested at night.  \\n-Try to keep your baby’s room dark and quiet during the night to help them get a good night’s sleep.  \\n\\nI\\n\\nHuman: It needs to be quiet?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, try not to use electronics that might make noise, or other light that will wake the baby up.  You might consider using a baby monitor so that you can hear what’s going on while you’re away from the baby, as long as it doesn’t have a light or other component that might keep the baby awake.\\n\\nHuman: What about a sound machine that plays white noise?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, this might be useful to sooth the baby to sleep.  Make sure it doesn’t have any flashing lights or other features that might be distracting for the baby, though.  \\nSince you want the baby to fall asleep on their own during the night, you want the sound machine to be white noise, rather than something with rhythm or song.\\n\\nHuman: Is pink noise or white noise better?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",
