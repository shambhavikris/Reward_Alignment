It has a bill like a duck, fur like a mammal, and lays eggs like a reptile.  The platypus is an unusual and fascinating animal, and is sometimes referred to as the \\u201cduckbill platypus\\u201d.  Platypuses are naturally aquatic, and spend most of their time swimming and eating fish.  They also make loud vocalizations, including screeching and hissing sounds.\\n\\nHuman: Where can you find them?\\n\\nAssistant: Platypuses are found in Australia and some neighboring countries.  They live in rivers, streams, and lakes, and often hide in burrows or underwater tunnels during the day.  Platypuses are common and easy to observe in zoos and wildlife parks, and they can also be seen in the wild in Australia and other parts of their range.\\n\\nHuman: Do they live near water?  Do they swim?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Does mankind still have enough time to reverse climate change?\\n\\nAssistant: The biggest issue we face right now is getting everyone to agree that climate change is real and that we need to take action.  We also need to speed up the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, and away from fossil fuels.  So there\\u2019s still a lot we can do, but we need to act quickly if we want to have a good chance of preventing some of the worst impacts of climate change.\\n\\nHuman: Hwo can people still deny science in this day and age?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Should I buy my child a classic kindle or a fire one?\\n\\nAssistant: What kind of books does your child like to read?  Does he or she prefer electronic or print?\\n\\nHuman: either one\\n\\nAssistant: Is your goal to give your child something to read?  Or is your goal to give your child a reading/writing experience?  If it\\u2019s the first, the kindle would be a good choice.  You can buy one from amazon or the kindle store.  It\\u2019s an affordable way for your child to enjoy reading books on their kindle, either electronically or in print form.  They also come with games and other kid-friendly features.\\n\\nIf you want your child to have a reading/writing experience, the fire kindle would be better.  It\\u2019s got a bright screen that they can read from, and it also has an integrated writing area, where they can type.  It also comes with a way for parents to monitor and manage the experience for their children.\\n\\nHuman\\n\\nHuman: So you mean the original kindle, not the fire?\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9178], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8765], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8910], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_rejected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9032], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9827], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8226], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It has a bill like a duck, fur like a mammal, and lays eggs like a reptile.  The platypus is an unusual and fascinating animal, and is sometimes referred to as the \\u201cduckbill platypus\\u201d.  Platypuses are naturally aquatic, and spend most of their time swimming and eating fish.  They also make loud vocalizations, including screeching and hissing sounds.\\n\\nHuman: Where can you find them?\\n\\nAssistant: Platypuses are found in Australia and some neighboring countries.  They live in rivers, streams, and lakes, and often hide in burrows or underwater tunnels during the day.  Platypuses are common and easy to observe in zoos and wildlife parks, and they can also be seen in the wild in Australia and other parts of their range.\\n\\nHuman: Do they live near water?  Do they swim?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Does mankind still have enough time to reverse climate change?\\n\\nAssistant: The biggest issue we face right now is getting everyone to agree that climate change is real and that we need to take action.  We also need to speed up the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, and away from fossil fuels.  So there\\u2019s still a lot we can do, but we need to act quickly if we want to have a good chance of preventing some of the worst impacts of climate change.\\n\\nHuman: Hwo can people still deny science in this day and age?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Should I buy my child a classic kindle or a fire one?\\n\\nAssistant: What kind of books does your child like to read?  Does he or she prefer electronic or print?\\n\\nHuman: either one\\n\\nAssistant: Is your goal to give your child something to read?  Or is your goal to give your child a reading/writing experience?  If it\\u2019s the first, the kindle would be a good choice.  You can buy one from amazon or the kindle store.  It\\u2019s an affordable way for your child to enjoy reading books on their kindle, either electronically or in print form.  They also come with games and other kid-friendly features.\\n\\nIf you want your child to have a reading/writing experience, the fire kindle would be better.  It\\u2019s got a bright screen that they can read from, and it also has an integrated writing area, where they can type.  It also comes with a way for parents to monitor and manage the experience for their children.\\n\\nHuman\\n\\nHuman: So you mean the original kindle, not the fire?\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9178], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8765], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8910], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_rejected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9032], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9827], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.8226], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sum\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([1.8210], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([1.8592], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([1.7135], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

When the war started in 1939, Germany was fighting against much larger nations such as France, the U.K., and the USSR. It took a few years of fighting before Germany could take control of any territory outside of its own borders. While Germany was winning, it was dependent on countries like Italy and Japan to supply it with war materials and aid. It was also struggling against Britain\\u2019s Royal Air Force and the RAF\\u2019s bombing campaigns over German cities. So, Germany\\u2019s progress was impressive, but it took years to take control of a majority of Europe and it wasn\\u2019t able to win the war outright.\\n\\nHuman: How did Japan augment Germany?

For example, if you are listening to music in the car, they can help you to block out the noise of the engine, and the road, and other external sounds.  Or if you are trying to sleep, they can help you to block out other sounds in the room, or your partner snoring, or other noise.  Basically they help you to block out background noise and help you focus on the sound you want to listen to.\\n\\nHuman: How does this technology work?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Can you recommend some of Richard Matheson's best books?\\n\\nAssistant: OK! The 13th Floor was a 1963 book, and this is probably the one I would recommend most as an introduction to his work.  In that book, the protagonist is a man who is kidnapped and taken to a building where he encounters the same sort of evil things that we\\u2019re familiar with in the movie I Am Legend.  It\\u2019s actually a great depiction of the building\\u2019s walls and corridors, and how claustrophobic and isolating they are, so that it feels like a different world.  \\nRichard Matheson wrote many other horror novels, including I Am Legend and The Incredible Shrinking Man.  This story is a real chill, especially in this idea that he is in this dark environment, and his family goes to find him.  He\\u2019s on the 13th floor, and there is no 13th floor, but somehow he\\u2019s still there.\\n\\nHuman: What is The Shrinking Man about?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a fun story that is so memorable, and it doesn\\u2019t seem like it\\u2019s going to have the ending we expect.  This book is so famous, and if you haven\\u2019t read it, I really encourage you to do so.  You will see some examples of claustrophobic situations, but even though that\\u2019s a theme in the book, it\\u2019s mostly about a man who tries to escape from this plot to kill him, while he is shrinking.\\n\\nHuman: Should I read The Shrinking Man or I Am Legend?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: Can someone just ignore a Congressional Subpoena?\\n\\nAssistant: The short answer is no, you can\\u2019t legally just ignore a Congressional subpoena.  But I think you\\u2019re asking about something more nuanced than that.  Perhaps you\\u2019re wondering how someone might get around a subpoena?  If so, let me explain.\\n\\nHuman: Yes.\\n\\nAssistant: Well, the important thing to remember is that a Congressional Subpoena is a legal document with certain formalities that must be obeyed.  This document spells out the authority of the committee that issued the subpoena and the obligation of the witness or entity being subpoenaed.  The committee is obligated to follow specific procedures in issuing the subpoena, and the subpoenaed is obligated to respond in the ways outlined.  As long as those rules are followed, the subpoena should not be ignored or taken lightly.  \\n\\nBut what if those rules are not followed?  A court could still enforce a Congressional Subpoena, but the process is complicated.  \\n\\nFor example, some clauses in a subpoena could be held invalid if the committee doesn\\u2019t follow proper procedure.  There are specific rules governing when a committee has the authority to issue a subpoena, and they need to be followed.  If the committee improperly asserts its authority, this could make the subpoena itself invalid.  If the court agrees that the subpoena is invalid, it would not be legally enforceable.

It\\u2019s hard to come up with a way to reduce your emotional reaction, since it is connected to your self-image.  One thing I\\u2019ve found to be helpful is to identify specific examples of times when I felt similarly, and see if I can identify the circumstances and ways that I managed to overcome that feeling.\\n\\nHuman: So look to past experience for clues.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: I need a recipe for some fudge without using condensed milk.\\n\\nAssistant: If you just want plain fudge, then yes, it\\u2019s fine to use condensed milk.

I haven\\u2019t heard of a jeweler myself, so I\\u2019m going to have to guess a bit about that career.  Jewelers typically do all kinds of beautiful handwork, like repairing or making rings, necklaces, or earrings, or making or repairing items with gemstones or precious metals.  They can also cut gemstones, or work with gold, silver, copper, or other precious metals.  Jewelers have expertise in working with expensive materials, so many are also involved in trading and dealing in these items, either privately or in stores and markets.  It sounds like a lot of skill is involved, and it can be very fulfilling to make beautiful, practical items with gems and metals.  Jewelers can often make quite a good living at their work, depending on what kind of work they do, and where.

It’s hard to come up with a way to reduce your emotional reaction, since it is connected to your self-image.  One thing I’ve found to be helpful is to identify specific examples of times when I felt similarly, and see if I can identify the circumstances and ways that I managed to overcome that feeling.\\n\\nHuman: So look to past experience for clues.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

He promised to make Germany great again, including being able to live better than the US, which has largely been untouched by the Great Depression.  He also campaigned to “take care” of people by paying generous benefits to veterans, pensioners, widows, orphans, and the disabled, but also to make sure the “common good” is protected by making his “special police force” (SS) stronger and more powerful than the regular police force.  The economy did get a bit better under Hitler, because the SS drove out immigrants and forced them to work, making Germany’s unemployment rate go down.  But Hitler went too far by invading neighboring countries (even in alliance with other countries at the time), and by finally attacking Poland on September 1, 1939.  That led the United States and Britain to declare war on Germany, and made it difficult for Hitler’s regime to survive.  Germany lost the war, and Hitler and his top officials were tried at the Nuremberg Trials and executed by the Allied Forces.\\n\\nHuman: So he took advantage of the bad times the country was going through to rise to power.

Many people identify Selena with an incredibly dramatic rise to fame, which I think can only be called meteoric.  Selena herself came from a musical family, and many of her relatives were involved in music.  Her father A.B. Quintanilla III, better known as “A.B.” in the group Los Dinos, was one of the most influential men in Selena’s career.  \\n\\nSelena joined her father’s band in 1980 at age 13.  Within months, she was given a prominent role as a dancer and vocalist.  She quickly became famous as a dancer, first in her father’s group, and then in her own.  However, Selena’s manager and her father’s business partner, Chris Pérez, decided to position her as a female singer-songwriter.  Despite having no prior musical training, she began to record and release songs, and in a few years, she had a commercial hit with a cover version of Gloria Estefan’s “No me qales como una artista.”  Selena became one of the first major crossover performers, creating a blend of Latin pop, American country, and Tejano that redefined Tejano\\n\\nHuman: okay, so she was able to bring a new genre of music to the USA..\\n\\nWhat happened to her at the end?\\n\\nAssistant: In February 1995, Selena was killed in a drive-by shooting at a concert in Corpus Christi, Texas.  She was shot by Yolanda Saldivar, an employee of her husband and former business manager, Chris Perez.  At the time, Selena was performing a show as part of the Amor Prohibido tour, and was wearing a red dress.  Saldivar shot Selena in the back as she ran offstage, and Saldivar pleaded guilty to Selena’s murder.  Selena was only 23 years old.  After her death, her former band “Los Dinos” released the album “Dreaming of You” in 1996, which was certified platinum and featured songs written by Selena herself.  They went on to have continued success, and several members, including Selena’s father, continued to appear as singers or featured vocalists.\\n\\nHuman: I just cross checked that information and she was not killed at the scene you described.

Here are some good reasons to have a tortoise as a pet:  \\n- They’re much cheaper to care for than most other pets, especially the size of some of them.  You can get them from the pet store for around $20 or $30.  They can live in small spaces and are very easy to care for.  They’re also very low-maintenance.  And even if they escape from their cage, they can usually be easily found.  So you might save a lot of money if you have one.\\n\\n- They can be very interesting companions.  They have unique personalities, since each tortoise is a little bit different.  They also have a long lifespan, of up to 80 years in the wild.

What’s most important is that if you take care of them right, they’ll live very long, happy lives.  There are also lots of different species of tortoises and their lifestyles vary widely, so you might find one that better suits your needs.\\n\\nHuman: Will they come to you when you call them?\\n\\nAssistant: This will vary a lot from tortoise to tortoise.  Some of them will, while others are a bit more shy.  They also don’t have ears and so can’t hear very well, so it’s not always obvious when they’re listening to you.  You might have better luck with a smaller one.  The good news is, if you decide to keep them as pets, they’ll stick around for a long time and you’ll learn how to care for them.  It might be more work to find them when they first arrive than it is to just have them stay at home in a cage, but you won’t have to worry about taking them to the vet or putting a collar around them.\\n\\nHuman: What do you feed them?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Is there a way to target that area for fat loss.?\\n\\nAssistant: There are several reasons why this might be happening.  The first would be genetic.  Everyone is programmed to put on fat in different places, some people have higher body fat percentages, so we tend to gain weight on our stomachs and our thighs, but less on our upper arms or back.  This is not something that can be changed, but you can choose to change where you put on fat by your diet.  In this case you should try to focus on eating less and more regularly, and lower calorie.  For fat loss, the problem area will probably still be getting bigger, but the rest of your body won’t get any bigger because your diet is so restricted.\\n\\nHuman: What about something like cool sculpting.

In some constitutional monarchies, for example, there may be a bicameral parliament where the monarch has no vote, but is instead the official head of the executive branch, having the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet members.  Another system, called a parliamentary democracy, has no role for the monarch at all.\\n\\nHuman: Which country developed the concept of a constitutional monarchy?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s really hard to say who developed the idea first, as it’s such a broad concept.  But I’d guess that in England, this idea was first implemented by King William I in about the year 1070, in the form of the Magna Carta.  That document limited the power of the King by constraining his ability to act without the consent of the aristocracy, and it also included certain basic rights of the nobility and the common people, such as the right to a trial by jury.\\n\\nHuman: When was the Magna Carta developed?\\n\\nAssistant: The Magna Carta was probably written between 1215 and 1217 by King John, although the exact details are up for debate.

First of all, how loud are you?  When your voice is not loud enough for the song, you may need to project more volume in order to be heard.  Do you know about changing your breathing to sing at a different volume?  This works very similarly to singing in a lower or higher register, in that you will need to adjust the volume of the voice by adding or subtracting from your existing breathing.

If so, then it’s possible that you are entering your falsetto range.  I recommend looking up “falsetto” on Wikipedia for a definition, as it’s not my strong suit.

It’s extremely painful and can cause you to miss work or school.  That’s what I remember hearing about in my classes as an undergraduate student studying oral biology, anyway.  There are several things you can do to manage the pain or to try to get rid of the abscess faster.\\n\\nHuman: What are they?\\n\\nAssistant: Here’s what I remember the dentist telling me about how to manage the pain: you can ask the dentist for a prescription for a painkiller like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.  Another thing you can do is to try to apply hot and cold compresses to the area around the tooth, for maybe half an hour at a time.  And finally, you can bite down on the tooth that’s abscessed, which will take some of the pressure off.  Biting down can actually cause more pain though, so if you can do it while alternating with the hot and cold compresses, that might be best.\\n\\nHuman: I think I will pass on the biting down.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Third, try using a variety of cutting techniques (chopping, dicing, mincing, shredding, etc.) so that your knife doesn’t need to re-sharpen.

We can get started by learning some of the main ideas in learning the ABCs:\\n\\n1) First, we’ll need to teach them about the concept of an alphabet (or set of letters).  This idea is important because the child will be able to see the alphabet at the center of the concept.\\n\\n2) We’ll also need to talk about the sound of each letter.  We can help the child discover that each letter has a name and a sound.  We can give the child the letters one at a time, and then start combining them together.\\n\\n3) We can begin with short and simple sounds for the child to hear, and then build on that.

              " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Can you give me advice for growing tomatoes?\\n\\nAssistant: Tomatoes are very nutritious and tasty vegetables!  They’re also very simple to grow at home.  Here’s a very basic set of instructions:\\n\\nTomatoes are in the same family as eggplants, peppers, and cucumbers, so like them, they’re a kind of “fruit” rather than a “plant”.  They grow like a little bush, so you don’t need much in the way of actual plants.  Just choose a spot in your garden or outside, and buy a starter plant from your local nursery.  Make sure you water the starter plant and follow the directions they give you, so it can establish a good root system and produce its first fruit or two.  The starter plant is simply the mother plant for the rest of your tomato plants, so after it starts growing, keep cutting off its own flowers and fruit and letting it make more seedlings for your next year’s plants.\\n\\nHuman: I have a good spot picked out in my garden where it gets plenty of sun.\\n\\nAssistant: Great, you’ll need to prepare the soil for the seedlings.  Do a bit of research first, because tomatoes do require some special soil nutrients that are different from what other plants might need, but can be easily added to most garden soil.  Let’s say you’ve bought fertilizer and are waiting for the right time of year to plant.\\n\\nHuman: After I plant the tomato plant in the ground, how long will it take to start getting tomatoes from it?\\n\\nAssistant: That depends on the weather, but you can expect the plant to start producing tomatoes at the end of the summer.  In most of the country, it will be August or September, but in hotter areas like Florida, the growing season will be earlier.  When the tomatoes start to show color and ripeness, cut them off at the stem and bring them in to your kitchen.  Then just wait until they’re fully ripe and ready to be eaten.  If you live in a cool, rainy area, you might want to construct a small canopy over the tomato plants.  The cover should let in enough light to allow them to grow, but will prevent excessive watering and puddling from the rain.\\n\\nHuman: How many plants should I have for a family of four? I don't want to plant too many.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Some people do it voluntarily for religious or spiritual reasons, but it’s generally not recommended for non-religious reasons.  For example, Wikipedia says that for the purpose of healthy weight loss and metabolic maintenance, there’s more to consider than just the number of calories you eat or don’t eat.  That sounds like a good rule of thumb that you can keep in mind if you’re wondering whether or not to fast.\\n\\nHuman: What about intermittent fasting?

A 16:8 regimen is a short term or “cheat day” regimen where you only eat between 800 and 1200 calories for just 2 days per week.  It’s a bit tricky to do, and probably not worth the health risks of a potential yo-yo effect (regaining weight after the diet).  In terms of health benefits, research on this isn’t quite definitive.

To train your breath-holding capacity, you could try these three tips:\\n\\n-Focus on using your diaphragm to expand your lungs.  This is the muscle that’s located between your stomach and lungs.  When you breathe, you should feel your diaphragm pushing down.\\n\\n-Once your lungs are full of air, resist the urge to exhale immediately.

              " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Hi, how does a touch screen phone work?\\n\\nAssistant: We can walk through the pieces of a touch screen phone together.  I’ll try to give you a simple and direct explanation, using words you know.  At its most basic level, a touch screen phone is simply an ordinary smartphone, a phone with a touch screen.  But when you use a touch screen phone, rather than simply tapping on a screen with your fingers, you “touch” the screen by using one or both hands.  So, one hand is the “main” hand, while the other is the “secondary” hand.  When the main hand “touches” the screen, this is called the “touch.”  The touch can be “detected” by the phone.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. But how does the screen sense where your finger is in order to know where you're touching it?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, it does this by detecting infrared light.  When you use your finger to touch the screen, it blocks a portion of the light waves from the screen that are bouncing off of your finger.  So the phone has infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and infrared sensors in the screen that can “see” your finger and the blocked light.   There’s also another technology, capacitive sensing, which detects the capacitance of the skin of your finger and its dielectric properties.  These also work, but infrared sensing is easier.\\n\\nHuman: Is capacitive touch screen technology used more than infrared sensors now?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, that’s right, there are more capacitive screens than infrared screens now.  In terms of the newest smartphones, almost all of them have touchscreens that use capacitive technology.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Can you tell me more about capacitive screens? I want to know more about the most modern touch screen technology.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, we can explore capacitive screens.  They rely on electrical fields.  To create a capacitive screen, you add a layer of conductive material on the glass surface of the screen.  This is very thin metal, like indium tin oxide, ITO.  ITO is a very strong conductor and can make a very thin layer that’s still conductive.  It’s about 1,000 times more conductive than copper, and 100 times more conductive than human skin.  So you can make a really thin capacitive screen with this material, even if it’s just half a millimeter thick.  You’ll also have to lay down a very thin layer of a “dielectric” material between this conductive layer and the glass.  There are many dielectrics that can be used.  The one that’s most commonly used for capacitive screens is called “polyimide” or PPI.\\n\\nHuman: So how does a capacitive touch screen on a phone know when some place on the screen is being pressed?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

To prevent mold from forming in showers and tubs, you should use ventilation fans to remove moisture from the room, or a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air.  Either one of these will help keep the humidity low.  If you don’t have a vent fan or a dehumidifier, a small fan pointing towards the ceiling will prevent moisture from building up and will also help prevent mold from developing.  Washing your shower curtain and walls with hot water will also help prevent mold from forming.

Gold was rare in the Europe of that time, and they couldn’t explain it scientifically, so they decided to ascribe it to mysterious elves.  The leprechauns were described as a particularly weird type of elf.  “Leprechaun” comes from “Luchruinn”, an Irish word for little body (corruptions of the word “luch”, meaning “body”, and “ruadh”, meaning “little”).  The word “leprechaun” entered the English language in the 18th century.\\n\\nHuman: Are they real?\\n\\nAssistant: They don’t have solid evidence for their existence, so they’re probably not.  They’re a bit like the elves in Tolkien’s books.  They aren’t quite real, but it’s fun to think about them as real.  Some people are very interested in leprechauns, and hunt for them in the woods.

But there’s no evidence that leprechauns make pot of gold, or that they exist.\\n\\nHuman: What do they have to do with rainbows?\\n\\nAssistant: Leprechauns like to hide their gold under a rainbow, because they’re very shy and they don’t want to be seen by other people.  There’s an old Irish folk song called “My Darling Boy” about a leprechaun who hides his pot of gold under a rainbow, because he’s afraid that his treasure might be stolen.  In the song, the leprechaun is described as a little man, rather than an elf, because it’s actually based on an older, Gaelic folk tale about an Irish leprechaun.  The main idea of the song is that if you want to find the gold, you should follow the rainbow.\\n\\nHuman: Are they related elves or fairies?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

By around three months most babies are sleeping through the night, but their sleep schedules can be extremely unpredictable and weird at this age.  \\nFor most babies, you can help them sleep better by following these guidelines: \\n\\n-Try to keep your baby’s routine as consistent as possible.  That includes things like feeding times, bathing times, naps, and bedtimes.  \\n-Try to feed them just before they’re too tired to stay awake.  That way, they’ll fall asleep while you’re holding them.  \\n-If you have to wake them up to feed them in the middle of the night, try to get back to sleep as quickly as possible and use a soother or other gentle lullaby to help them back to sleep.  \\n-If you’re having trouble getting back to sleep, try to get some sleep during the day so that you’ll be more rested at night.  \\n-Try to keep your baby’s room dark and quiet during the night to help them get a good night’s sleep.  \\n\\nI\\n\\nHuman: It needs to be quiet?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The cable car will carry you from a higher street to a lower street, so the cable car operator will stop it between a block, so you can get on or off.  There are 100-year-old cables that power the cable cars, and they’re inspected regularly.  If there was a problem, the cable cars would stop immediately and warn riders about the emergency.\\n\\nHuman: 100 Years!  It has been around that long?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes!

You can simply sprinkle on some seasoning, wrap them in a tortilla, and enjoy! \\n-   Chips:  It’s kind of like cooking your chips in a mini-frying pan.  Just don’t overfill the air fryer basket, or it’ll likely break and mess up your fryer!\\n-   Chocolate:  I know this sounds odd, but it’s delicious and so easy to cook!  No, the fryer won’t catch on fire like with chocolate chips, so don’t worry!  Simply place your chocolate pieces on a pan with about a teaspoon of oil in it, and allow them to melt and cool down.  Then you can pour the chocolate into the air fryer and enjoy!\\n\\nHuman: Chicken sounds good. Chips sounds interesting.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Keep away from underwater reefs, which will usually harbor small predators like sharks.  Do not enter deep water if you are alone, and especially if you are unaccompanied by a trained shark-spotter or professional shark fisherman.  Choose a shark-spotting location that is well-lit, and wait there while you decide if it is safe to continue swimming.  Swim parallel to the shore when conditions are dangerous, such as when surf conditions are present.  It is never wise to wear high-contrast colors while swimming, especially when you are close to a reef, which attracts high-contrast fish that will easily attract sharks.  If you do see a shark, and especially if you see its teeth, do not run or struggle in the water, but gently put your hands in the air and float so the shark will believe you are not a food item.  And most importantly: keep your wits about you at all times, and take care to always swim with a companion, such as a shark-spotter or a shark fisherman.\\n\\nHuman: What should I do if I ever encounter a shark?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It’s actually a little difficult to find any studies that specifically look at western men’s opinions, so we might have to go a bit wider.  A 2015 survey found that 9.1% of men in the US wear nail polish at least sometimes, and that was by far the largest proportion of any country in the survey.  We can get a better idea of what people think about men wearing nail polish by looking at previous studies on transgender men who don’t have a choice about their gender expression, or on people in other cultures.  Studies from different parts of the world found that 14-34% of women approve of men wearing nail polish (with a range of 13% in Russia, and 36% in Brazil).\\n\\nHuman: Why is nail polish seen as feminine in western countries?\\n\\nAssistant: There are probably many different factors that play a role.  Feminine gender expression is often associated with household tasks or caring for others, so these can be seen as feminine in and of themselves.  Also, in most western cultures, men have been socialized to be more active in outdoor activities and more physically independent than women, so nail polish can stand out as relatively feminine.  In addition, it’s important to consider that women have historically been valued for their physical attractiveness and often judged based on how well they present themselves, and people generally think men should just focus on their work and not worry about appearance.\\n\\nHuman: But why is nail polish associated with this? For example, why is nail polish associated with household tasks and caring for others?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

What is the origin of hummus?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not sure where it was first invented, but hummus has been popular for many centuries, and is originally from the Middle East.  It’s made with ground chickpeas, and may have a very different taste depending on the region where it is eaten.  In the Middle East, it is commonly made with sesame paste and tahini, which are both made from ground sesame seeds, and with cumin, cayenne, and a few other spices.  In the United States, there is often a lot of garlic in it, and sometimes fresh lemon juice or other acidic ingredients.  People use hummus in many dishes as a sort of “dip”, like you mentioned, and also as a base for salads.  Some people also put hummus in a blender with other ingredients, such as feta cheese, tomatoes, or pine nuts, and that creates a “hummus dip” or “hummus spread”, which can then be used as a kind of dip for other things.  In some places in the Middle East, there are dishes that are simply prepared with ground chickpeas and nothing else, as a main dish, so it is not always eaten as a “dip” or “spread”.\\n\\nHuman: I found this information online:  \"That being said, though, based on historical information, hummus likely originated from ancient Egypt.\"  Is this fact correct?\\n\\nAssistant: I found a Wikipedia article about hummus that says that early sources in Egypt mention a bean paste made from garbanzo beans.  The theory that this is hummus is based on evidence from early papyrus rolls, which include a list of foods called the “Love Letter Papyrus”, which appears to contain the word “hummus”.  Also, garbanzo beans are called “ful” in early Egyptian texts.   But it’s certainly not clear if this paste is the same as what is now known as “hummus”, and there’s debate about the translation of the word “hummus”, and also some debate over whether the word “ful” really does mean “chickpeas”.  It’s possible that people in ancient Egypt did make a paste from beans, which they then ate as a spread, but we can’t be certain if it’s the same as the dish called hummus today.\\n\\nHuman: Are chickpeas and garbanzos the same thing?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Sugar is glucose, and your body breaks it down and uses it.  Artificial sweeteners like saccharine are about 30-50 times sweeter than table sugar, which means your body will use a lot more to get the same amount of calories.  To prevent this over-exposure, your body will turn the extra calories into fat.  This makes artificial sweeteners a health risk.\\n\\nHuman: Is it difficult for the body to break down artificial sweeteners?\\n\\nAssistant: Some human:  Yes, artificial sweeteners are very hard to break down, so your body treats them like a foreign invader, and it produces more insulin to force them out of the body.  This leads to insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes.  However, many of these health concerns could be avoided if the diet of the individual didn’t involve high-sugar foods, like desserts and beverages.  This is because a sugar diet is more likely to be a bigger problem than the artificial sweeteners themselves.\\n\\nHuman: How does the body react to artificial sweeteners?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Yoga, like all religions, includes spiritual beliefs and a set of practices intended to enact them.  Yoga’s spiritual beliefs center on achieving a clear, calm mind through meditation and consistent engagement with the body.   For many people, this can seem similar to a mind-body connection, but spiritual and meditation techniques are actually integral parts of yoga.\\n\\nHuman: I thought it was based on buddhism..\\n\\nAssistant: In modern times, yoga is often associated with both Hinduism and Buddhism.  Hinduism is the world’s third-largest religion, and it has deep roots in Asia, dating back thousands of years.  As far back as the 1500s, Hindu gurus (like yogis) began to teach followers new ways to meditate to achieve spiritual enlightenment.  Buddhism, founded around the same time, also teaches people to focus on meditation and developing a clear mind, though Buddhists are more typically focused on an individual’s own inner spiritual development.

There are different ways to measure “rich”, and also there’s a lot of different factors that can influence how rich you are.  \\n\\nFor example, a millionaire might live in a small home, but the house could be next to a state park and have an ocean view.  They might spend their money on food and experiences rather than housing.  Or maybe they give a lot of their money away, so they don’t end up rich in a traditional sense.  And another key factor is that there were a lot fewer people in the United States back then, so even if you had a lot of money, it might not go as far as it does today.  \\n\\nSo I don’t have a perfect answer, but I did some research to get a sense of what we know.  It looks like some people called “socialites” were mentioned in the New York Times during this time, but it was often in the context of society balls.  There are also reports of people who got in debt or who took huge gambles on investments and lost a lot of money.  There were also families who lost everything during the Stock Market Crash, and many lost a\\n\\nHuman: Richest in terms of net worth.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, right, sorry.  \\n\\nThat’s more complicated, but I did try to gather some answers about what’s considered “the richest” by various experts.  The main thing to know is that there were a lot of business tycoons in the late 19th and early 20th century, and the people who were wealthy back then might not be considered rich today.  \\n\\nHere are some examples, from Wikipedia and an encyclopedia:  \\n\\nMr. John D. Rockefeller became the first person on record to own a billion dollars in 1913.  But just a few years later, the father of Wall Street investor J.P. Morgan was worth a reported 1.1 billion, while another investor Andrew Carnegie was worth 1.4 billion.  There’s also Henry Ford, who owned the Ford Motor Company.  He was worth 2.4 billion at his peak, but by today’s standard he wouldn’t be considered super rich.  \\n\\nBut another point that’s hard to account for is how a person could have been richer or poorer back then based on where they lived.  \\n\\nFor example, think about how much more space you can buy on average today.  There’s also the cost of living -- food and\\n\\nHuman: Please list out the richest WOMEN in the United States around the year 1900.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I can tell you how to re-pot the babies without damaging their roots.  The first thing I’d do is choose a bigger pot, with drainage holes.  Then I’d take a smaller pot and fill it with the same type of potting soil you have in your bigger pot.  Then I’d carefully pull the baby plants out of the big pot and plant them into the smaller pot.  The smaller pot should be bigger than the new root ball, but the plant should still be able to grow into the pot.  So if you had a baby plant with a root ball around 6cm wide, you could put it into a smaller pot that’s around 8cm wide.  You should also water them regularly, as with any young plants.\\n\\nHuman: I bet the roots of the babies and the mother plant are all twisted up together. How can I separate them?\\n\\nAssistant: Sometimes the mother plant may have a thick mass of roots, and it’s hard to tell where the roots of the babies end and where the mother plant begins.  The best way to separate them is to take a trowel and remove a layer of the soil, just to see how the roots are arranged.  The mother plant should be at the bottom.  If this is true, I think the best thing to do would be to carefully pull the mother plant out of the pot, and re-pot the baby plants separately.\\n\\nHuman: What if I have to cut some roots to separate them?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

To do it, you should probably preheat your oven to medium-high, and also turn on your stovetop’s gas burner.  You’ll need a pan, a small bowl of cream, some sugar, and a flame.  Try to ensure your flame is not actually touching the pan, and avoid letting the flame come anywhere near the cream!  You should pour some of the cream in a little bowl and let it sit to warm up, then very carefully pour that warmed cream into the bottom of your saucepan, taking care to avoid any spills.  Put a thermometer in the saucepan and start adding the sugar.  Keep stirring the mixture as the sugar dissolves, and use the flame to heat the mixture to 220°C (430°F), which will be a little over the boiling point of water.  The sugar should melt, become an amber color, and the mixture should thicken, but you should be careful not to burn it or let it get too hot!

The psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, for instance, has done research about how men’s and women’s brains differ in the structure of the so-called “amygdala”, an area of the brain that regulates social emotions.  One particularly interesting observation about how the two sexes process emotion, for example, is that when a female scientist is speaking at a scientific conference, her amygdala often shuts down – it literally goes into shutdown mode when she’s on stage.  The male scientist’s amygdala, on the other hand, is still active, and in fact still shows an increased level of activity in relation to his peers.  One theory is that this is the reason why more women than men are at home with their kids during the day, while the men are off at the office.  Studies have also shown that men are actually worse than women at facial recognition, despite what the popular stereotype might suggest.\\n\\nHuman: I had a feeling that women looked at some things differently than men.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: I would like to know the history of Catholicism?  Can you explain it to me?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, let’s get started.  There’s a great many articles and books that go into this topic in great depth, but I’ll try to give a brief overview here.  First off, what is Catholicism?  This term means “universal”.  Catholicism emphasizes a belief that all humans can be saved, which is opposed to the common belief that salvation comes from being part of the “one true church” (like the one in the Bible).  Catholics believe that the way to salvation is in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that this was recorded in the New Testament.  \\n\\nCatholicism began in Jerusalem with the Christian church established there by Jesus’ followers.  For several centuries the early church was small and fragmented, but then the Emperor Constantine moved to make the religion popular.  He claimed that a vision had told him to put the church’s symbol, the cross, on the shields of his army.\\n\\nHuman: Is the Catholic Church the largest Christian church?\\n\\nAssistant: It depends on how you measure it, and what you count as Christian.  Catholicism doesn’t have a unified view on this question, since there are millions of Catholics around the world, with different cultures and different degrees of connectedness to one another.  For example, in the Philippines Catholics make up most of the population, but this is not the case in most other countries.  \\n\\nBut the general answer is that yes, the Catholic church is the largest.  In fact, it’s so big that you can argue that Catholicism is a way of life, rather than just a religion.  Most Christians believe that Catholicism includes the traditions and teachings of the original Christian church.  It’s considered the true Christian church, while other Christian churches may have some very different beliefs about Jesus, God, salvation, and so on.\\n\\nHuman: Do the Catholics use the same Bible as the Protestants?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s not that simple.  The Catholic church has approved a particular set of books, but the version of these books can vary across the world.  In fact, some Catholic traditions have additional books.  Protestants use the “Bible” as a source of authority, but some Protestants (like the Reformed) believe that the books in the Catholic Bible can also be authoritative.  The Old Testament was written in Hebrew and Greek, while the New Testament was written in Greek.  The King James Version of the Bible was translated from Hebrew and Greek to English.\\n\\nHuman: Which Christian religion is the oldest?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Try writing slowly, and carefully, to make sure you get each letter right.  And you might want to practice your signature.  Try writing your name a few times to make sure you get it right every time.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, what is a fountain pen?\\n\\nAssistant: A fountain pen has a reservoir of ink inside it, and a nib that you press onto paper.

Well, let’s start from the beginning: 5G is the next generation of cell phone networks that are already rolling out in some parts of the United States.  In order to understand what it’s about, we need to understand the context for mobile phone networks in general.\\n\\nOne of the earliest things about 5G is that it will be fast!  On average, the most advanced versions of 5G will offer a range of one to two gigabytes per second, which is about 1000 times faster than a 4G network.  One gigabyte is so fast that it could handle about 1000 simultaneous YouTube videos.  More importantly, 5G networks are going to be better equipped for the kinds of high-bandwidth applications that only become possible when data rates are this high.  These applications include streaming very high resolution videos, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, virtual reality experiences, augmented reality, and so on.\\n\\nThe ability to handle this much data is part of a broader change that is driving 5G networks.  First, the new generation of phones that are made to support the network are going to be smaller, more power efficient, and include more computing capabilities.  Second, the software running in phones will be able to handle the high data rates better.\\n\\nThe first generation of 5G is being rolled out in some markets today, and these markets will have phones and new IoT devices that will be able to access the 5G network.  Second generation 5G should be coming in around 2021, and it’s important to keep in mind that phone manufacturers and software developers are still trying to figure out the best ways to utilize the networks at full speed.\\n\\n5G is already here for cellphone users, and a growing number of users will be able to experience it this year.\\n\\nHuman: Will 4G become obsolete or unsupported in the future, or will devices be backwards compatible with 4G?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

There are other substitutes that work in some recipes, including products made from vegetables or other plant products.  As an example, some brands of soy-based mayonnaise substitute for eggs in some salad dressings and they may also be used to bind some cakes.  If you have a specific recipe that you’re looking to make, you can probably use your favorite recipe search site to find other alternatives.\\n\\nHuman: All right, any other suggestions?\\n\\nAssistant: Here’s a short list of common ingredients that can help substitute for eggs.

Most of these are commonly used in baking, but they also have other applications.\\n\\nHuman: Sounds like I have a lot to choose from!\\n\\nAssistant: One other thing to consider when substituting ingredients is how much the new ingredient might change the flavor or color of the recipe.

You’ll need to figure out which equipment you’ll need to buy, and where you can practice on the slopes.  Skiing is a sport that you can do your whole life, so it’s never too late to start!  You’ll also need to learn about your equipment, like your boots, bindings, and poles, and where you can buy all of it.  Also, you should figure out which mountains you’d like to ski on and what that will require, as some have lessons and courses that help beginners.

I want to know how to stay on my feet.\\n\\nAssistant: Well it sounds like you have a great attitude to get started!  As a general approach, try to stay focused on staying upright.  When you ski, you generally want to follow one main direction: either forward or straight down.  Avoid areas like “trees”, “wooden stairs”, “side-hilling”, “wildflower gardens”, and “picturesque views of farmhouses”.  Keep in mind that skiing is a sport, so you’re not required to hit every wall and/or tree you see, but you are responsible for preventing yourself from doing so.  \\n\\nAs you learn, feel free to experiment with different speeds and directions.  A good way to practice staying upright is to work on understanding and maintaining your “turn radius”, which is the furthest you can turn in one direction before you start to fall down or off-course.  How fast you can safely turn your turn radius will depend on many things, including your balance, agility, ability to stop and change direction, and speed.  It will also depend on the terrain and equipment that you’re on.  \\n\\nLastly, since this is a skiing website, let’s talk a little bit about how to actually “ski”.

The high-tech kind of kitchen that might have an electronic stove top might only have an “extremely hot” setting, so the “simmer” will be just right.  Then, you’ll leave the pot covered for an hour or so.  You’ll also want to prepare the fish by rinsing it off and drying it with paper towels before cooking.\\n\\nHuman: Why do people like to poach fish instead of frying or baking them?\\n\\nAssistant: I’ve heard some say that it’s healthier, and that the gentle cooking preserves the omega 3 fats in fish better than when the fish is fried or baked.

The history of his life was significantly affected by racism.  Charles didn’t get to attend regular high school due to segregation, and he was therefore mostly homeschooled.  Charles got his start in music after hearing a record player by chance, and then learning how to play piano by himself.  In the 1950’s, Charles became known as a musician and began playing with bands and recording songs that he composed.  Charles composed dozens of songs, like “Georgia on my Mind” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You”, which have become favorites and standards.  Charles died in June 2004 at the age of 73.

Probably several months at least, and the nature of the fracture will determine how the bone needs to be supported and protected during the healing process.

A conservatorship is used for both these situations, but it can also be used as a temporary solution if someone is experiencing a sudden incapacity that might be short-term, or might be long-term.

First, I’d recommend asking your kid what would help them feel safer in their bed.  It could be that they just want to sleep with a light on, for example, or maybe they would prefer you to lie with them in their bed while they fall asleep.  If your kid has a specific sleep phobia or trauma, you may need to talk to a mental health professional and/or get some help from them.  There is no shame in asking for help!  Many parents feel overwhelmed or worried about sleep issues, and they are normal to feel this way.  But you don’t need to try to be the expert and solve the issue on your own.  It might feel like an honor to try and help your kid, but it’s better to do that with a professional who can help you and them.  Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you feel that you need it!

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Is timeout an effective means of discipline?\\n\\nAssistant: Timeout is an effective way to discipline children, but it should be used sparingly.  Parents who constantly rely on timeout to keep their kids in line risk allowing the situation to escalate out of control.  It’s also not a good option if you have multiple children at home, since it puts an arbitrary limit on how long each one can be “allowed” to misbehave for.  Instead, timeouts should be reserved for when a child is being persistently, intentionally disruptive or otherwise badly behaved.  They should also be used for short periods of time, and not allowed to continue indefinitely.  If a child is not responding to timeouts, or they’re not helping to correct the problem, it might indicate that they need more in-depth help or support, or that the problem might be more severe than you realize.  Similarly, if a child starts being really disruptive because they want to be punished by the timeout, it can be a sign of deeper issues that might need attention.  In either case, be sure to talk to your pediatrician or other mental health professional if you think there might be something more going on.  In general, timeout can be an effective way to stop kids from being really badly behaved, but it\\n\\nHuman: All right how long should I do timeout for?\\n\\nAssistant: Ideally, timeouts should last for 10-15 minutes, but that’s also too long to leave a young child in timeout for very often.  For older children or teens, you might want to use timeouts for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Keep the timeouts short, and limit the number of times they happen each day/week, to help avoid the cycle of reinforcement that I mentioned before.  And also be sure to talk to your kids during timeout, and make sure they understand why they’re there and what they need to do differently next time, so it doesn’t keep happening.\\n\\nHuman: And if the timeout does not work what do I do?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

One issue to consider here is that many plants, and especially the kind of plants we depend on for food, are actually really difficult to pollinate.  For example, many plants have flowers that only open during the night, which makes it hard for bees to get in.  \\n\\nIt’s also worth pointing out that honey bees are just one kind of bee, and there are many different kinds of bees that might still live on even if honey bees went extinct.  Also, other insects, like flies and wasps, pollinate some flowers.  \\n\\nIn any case, I’m not sure that I would give this claim a “strongly agree” rating, because this isn’t just about bees going extinct, it’s also about our system of agriculture.  In the long term, if we change our agricultural system to do a better job at supporting other pollinators, that might work out just fine!\\n\\nHuman: Albert Einstein said if bees were to disappear, the human race would be extinct in 4 years. Why is this?\\n\\nAssistant: That sounds like a bold claim!  I’m not sure I can make that calculation with any certainty, but I think the basic idea here is that humans are dependent on plants for food.  Many plants require pollination by bees.  \\n\\nThe way I think about this is that if humans don’t have access to enough food, we could starve to death.  And if our food comes from plants that don’t have enough pollinators, and we don’t make changes to our agriculture systems, then we might have trouble surviving.  But if we make changes to our agriculture, and we add more pollinators, then we might be alright.  And also, depending on the details of the calculation, the time frame may be significantly shorter than 4 years.  It might be a lot sooner than that.  Also, if human society was fundamentally and rapidly transformed in some other way, it might take a much shorter time to recover from that than 4 years!\\n\\nHuman: So how do we protect the honey bee population from getting lower?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You'll want to make a paste, and apply it to your scalp.  Be sure you get the consistency just right.  If the mixture is too thick, it might be hard to spread it evenly over your scalp.  If it's too thin, it might not color your hair deeply enough.  \\nIn terms of preparation, you'll want to mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, until you have a uniform paste.  Then, you'll want to apply the paste to your scalp.  To do this, you'll want to gently spread it with your fingers in a downward motion.  Make sure you cover your whole scalp.  If you want to dye your hair a particular color, you'll want to make sure you get the mixture as dark as possible, without making it too saturated of a color.  \\nTo help you achieve the right color, you'll want to start with a base of hydrogen peroxide.  The more peroxide you add, the darker your hair will be.  Likewise, you might want to start with more vinegar, or more dye, to help you achieve the right color intensity\\n\\nHuman: Okay, should I cut my hair before dying it?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, you'll want to make sure you have your hair trimmed neatly to a desired length, before you start dying it.  This will help you get a consistent look from your dye job, and also will help the dye application process work more smoothly.  You'll want to make sure you have your hair trimmed in a way that's consistent with your style preferences, and also so it's short enough that the dye will be able to penetrate all the way down to the roots.  You might want to trim your hair every few weeks to keep it at the right length.\\n\\nHuman: All right, that makes sense\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

She had a homemade video blog at first, and from there they were able to turn it into a reality TV show.  This happened in 2007, and the show became a hit right away.  This helped put the rest of the family on TV too.  So you might say that Kim Kardashian kind of launched it all for them, although you can also see that they were sort of ready for it too, based on their reality show and homemade video blog.\\n\\nHuman: How did Kim Kardashian become famous?\\n\\nAssistant: I think she originally gained popularity with her homemade video blog, and that’s really where the family got their start.

It’s also important to change your passwords regularly, to minimize the risk of someone discovering and hacking into your accounts.  You should also avoid using easily-guessable passwords, such as your name or other personal information, as these are easy for others to guess.

For example, you could describe a poem as being \"nocturnal\" if it\\'s full of feelings and stories that occur at night, or you could describe an insect as being \"nocturnal\" if it lives during the night, or you could describe a ritual as being \"nocturnal\" if it\\'s only done at night.\\n\\nHuman: What kind of animals are nocturnal?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer, since animals vary so widely in their daily habits.  For example, nocturnal birds don’t just fly around during the night, they also sleep during the day.  Nocturnal mammals, like bats, do fly around during the night, but they also sleep during the day, and they have a sort of reversed sleep cycle in that they’re mostly awake during the night and sleep mostly during the day.\\n\\nHuman: Are cats nocturnal?\\n\\nAssistant: It depends.  Some cats are nocturnal, meaning they mostly sleep during the day and are active at night.  This is a pattern that shows up quite often in cats, both wild and domesticated.  Some cats are crepuscular, which means that they prefer to be active during twilight, just before and just after sunrise and sunset.  Then there are some cats that are called “anthropoid”, which means that they’re active during both the day and the night, so they don’t really have a set sleep schedule.  For example, most cats and many dogs spend their nights wandering around and doing things, then sleep during the day.  In humans, it’s the reverse, we spend our days doing things, and sleep at night.\\n\\nHuman: Why are animals nocturnal?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Well, there are several Pantheons, but most people are probably referring to the Pantheon in Rome, Italy.  The Pantheon’s architecture dates to around 100 AD, although a church has existed on the site since the late 6th century.  The Pantheon was once a temple of ancient Rome, dedicated to the city’s pagan gods.  Then the site was renovated and turned into a Catholic Church, and later into a Catholic church.  In the 16th century, the Pantheon was damaged by a massive earthquake, and then it was restored into a church again, and later renovated again into a church and a Catholic basilica.  Finally, it was opened up as a museum in the 20th century.  I can go into more detail if you’d like!\\n\\nHuman: Who built the Pantheon?\\n\\nAssistant: The Pantheon was built by Emperor Hadrian.  He began building it in 118 AD as a temple of all the gods of ancient Rome.\\n\\nHuman: Was the emperor a Catholic?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s hard to say.  If by “Catholic” you mean the religion of the Catholic Church, that didn’t exist until around 500 AD.  At the time the Pantheon was being built, Emperor Hadrian was probably a pagan, and there were lots of different religions in the Roman Empire.  Christianity only became the most popular in the Roman Empire around the late 4th century, long after the Pantheon was built.\\n\\nHuman: Your explanation made sense.

So tabby cats could have been deified as a god by the Egyptians, but there are no concrete records of tabby cat worship.  The Egyptians worshipped a wide variety of animal gods, however, and they depicted them in their art, so it’s very likely that tabby cats were included.\\n\\nHuman: Is there a reason why Egyptians really liked worshipping cats?\\n\\nAssistant: The Egyptians regarded cats as creatures with mystical powers.  These powers included being able to see in the dark, communicating with the spirit world, being sensitive to vibrations in the earth, etc.  It also came to be believed that cats were reincarnations of dead humans, and their worship included feeding the cats with the funerary offerings to the dead.  A few cats were actually mummified and put in tombs, in a parallel with their human masters.  And the Egyptians even held huge annual feasts in honor of their cat god Mau, who was represented by a special statuette of a cat.  Perhaps most importantly for Egyptians, cats were regarded as having an extremely special relationship with their owner, a sort of master-pet relationship that goes above and beyond the usual pet-owner relationship.  And perhaps the most interesting cat-related Egyptian belief is the superstition that if a cat died, then their owner would die soon after.

The country was initially governed by a congress based in Philadelphia, then a constitution was created.  The country has been at war with Great Britain for much of its history.  During the Civil War, a few Southern states seceded from the country, eventually forming the Confederacy.  The Confederacy fought to preserve slavery, which was abolished soon after the war.  There was an economic downturn in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but the country began to industrialize after World War II, eventually becoming the most powerful country in the world.\\n\\nHuman: Can you name the 13 colonies?\\n\\nAssistant: I think there were 13 in 1776, and the original 13 Colonies were: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and New Hampshire.  But some states have since split off from other states, so New York and New Jersey are now separate states.\\n\\nHuman: Was George Washington the first President?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s right.

James Monroe became President in 1817, and he was followed by John Quincy Adams in 1825.  In 1829, Andrew Jackson became President and led the Democratic Party.  He was followed by Martin Van Buren in 1837, and James K. Polk in 1845.  There was a civil war in the country for over four years, which ended with Abraham Lincoln being elected President in 1860.

Before you apply makeup, there are a few steps you can take. First of all, when your skin is dry, you need to be more gentle with yourself.  I’d recommend using your ring and pinky fingers to apply makeup, as opposed to the top of your index finger.  In the shower, and also on the way to your first appointment of the day, do not use a towel.  Dry your skin naturally.  While your skin is still damp, squeeze a little bit of a cream-based moisturizer, rather than lotion, onto your fingers and gently spread it on your face.

The general process is as follows.  \\nAll cars have GPS receivers, which constantly take readings of the sky at different wavelengths.  There are three commonly used readings, called L1, L2 and L5.  L1 and L2 are very high frequency signals, and L5 is slightly lower frequency.  These readings are recorded by the GPS receivers, but are corrupted by the noise of the car, the heat of the engine and other sources.  To counteract this, they’re corrected by an onboard computer in the car, and then stored.  Whenever you ask your GPS device to “navigate” somewhere, it’s able to use the readings to determine your approximate position, based on the position the car was in when the readings were stored.  And the more readings there are, the more accurate the location.  This works by the GPS device “triangulating” its location relative to nearby locations, and applying some known\\n\\nHuman: What does triangulating mean?\\n\\nAssistant: Sorry, this is an ambiguous word because of its use in physics.

But you also asked about it being well known, and I think this is because it\\'s close to several other well-known tourist sites.

There are several famous restaurants and wineries nearby, like Trattoria D\\'Orcia, which is located in a castle from the 15th century.

The station you want is the nearest train station is called Lucignano, and the trip there takes about two hours.  If you look at the train schedule, you can find trains that take you there several times a day, and also from multiple different cities.  I\\'ve also highlighted a few nice places nearby the train station, like the small Piazza Della Cisterna, where you can look at the Fountain of the Unicorn.\\n\\nHuman: Why are you embarrassed to recommend me to take a train?\\n\\nAssistant: I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just that I know that I will get criticized for recommending that.

One of the major techniques used for anxiety disorders is to try to break your fears down into smaller components, in order to test if there is any logical basis for them.  For example, you could ask yourself, “Is there any chance that X will happen?” or “Is X even possible?”  Many fears seem very real and solid to the person experiencing them, but the truth is, many fears are rather vague and do not contain any useful information, they just sound bad or dangerous.\\n\\nHuman: Should you just face your fears as best you can?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

For this purpose, just put the food in the fryer with the air fryer switched on, and you’ll have perfectly cooked, crispy foods in no time!

One is that your body can’t respond properly to insulin, and the other is that the cells of your body have trouble responding to insulin.  The low-carb diet, also known as the ketogenic diet, usually works by encouraging your body to use fat instead of glucose as an energy source.  But it might also be helpful for people with insulin resistance to focus on eating less glucose or starch.\\n\\nHuman: So, based on your information, should I eat wheat spaghetti instead of flour spaghetti?\\n\\nAssistant: Your body will use glucose, or “sugar”, first to fuel your body’s energy needs.  There are other sources of energy for your body, and they’re called “ketones”, but your body can’t switch over to ketones as readily as it can switch over to glucose.  For this reason, wheat spaghetti will give your body a higher amount of glucose, and so will be more likely to keep your blood glucose at the high levels that are risky for you, while flour spaghetti will give you a lower amount of glucose.  That said, it might be worth experimenting with it, and see how your blood glucose responds.\\n\\nHuman: I always thought that wheat spaghetti is healthier than flour spaghetti but you said that it has a higher amount of glucose?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

To know what that means, I think it will help if I explain the basics of sampling in more detail.  Let me see if I can make this as clear as possible.  The big problem with traditional polls of national populations is that you can't talk to everyone.  Even the poorest, most uneducated person in the world might be too far away, or unable to give up their time to participate.  And this gets really rough really quickly -- to understand the opinions of a group, you have to talk to a sample of the group, but you can't talk to a sample that doesn't include everybody.\\n\\nSo with traditional polling, this means that the poll must necessarily be an inaccurate sample of the whole population.

When I first looked into them, I saw that it seems like one of their most innovative design aspects is their focus on in-house production and R&D.   This is a big part of why they’re so successful at designing reliable products, because Honda engineers and R&D employees are deeply invested in the company and the products, rather than just assigned to the project.   And it also seems that Honda values a strong work ethic.  These seem to be related to the fact that they are so committed to maintaining their own factory space.  They’ve been continuously using their own production facilities for nearly 50 years, which would be very difficult for companies that are outsourcing manufacturing.  They like to keep their manufacturing production stream as “tight” as possible, which I think means they want to keep it under their own management and control.\\n\\nHuman: They do have very tight tolerances in manufacturing!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

To some extent you can’t avoid them, but you can try to do a few things to make her moodiness less overwhelming.  There’s not always an easy way to accomplish this, but you could try the following: \\n- Set some expectations about her behavior and ask her to keep her temper in check.  For example, ask her not to scream, to speak to you respectfully, and to stay in a good mood.  - After she exhibits the behavior you don’t like, you could also remind her of the expectations, and maybe try a little roleplaying to help her practice being more relaxed.\\n-  Be patient.  If the bad moods are bad enough to completely disturb her social and academic life, try to talk it out with your doctor, or your therapist.  There’s not a guaranteed way to fix it, but a few techniques might be helpful:  First of all, it’s really important for her to get plenty of sleep, at least 7 hours per night, so try to get her to make sure she’s doing that every night.

If you’re exposed to sound levels that are too high, it can cause damage to your hearing over time, and also be painful.  Likewise, if you’re exposed to sound levels that are too high on a short-term basis, it can also cause damage to your hearing.

Likewise, if you’re exposed to loud sounds on a short-term basis, they can also cause damage to your hearing.  The way they cause damage is that the volume of the sound can cause your eardrums to vibrate very strongly.  This vibration can over time cause damage to your ear canals, which is where your hearing occurs.  The second source of damage is that you can also be exposed to sounds that are loud enough that they can create excessive amounts of pressure in your ears, and cause them to feel painful.

Your baby has recently learned to walk, and you want to keep your baby safe from injury.  \\nFirst of all, babies are generally better at learning this than adults, because their bodies are more flexible.  Also, babies’ brains work differently than adults, and they may learn to walk in a different way.  Babies are naturally less stable than adults and may be more likely to fall.  Babies are more likely to fall down when they are tired, so make sure they are well-rested.  Small children should not try to learn to walk on uneven ground, which may lead to falling.  On a flat surface, you should watch your child carefully when they first start walking, to make sure they can do it safely.  You should also watch your child carefully when you are not right there next to them.\\n\\nHuman: How about a helmet?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, many parents choose to give their babies a helmet.

This is really important, because helmets are only effective if they fit properly and don’t fall off.  You should also make sure the helmet doesn’t hurt your baby.  Generally, when choosing a helmet, you should look at other parents’ suggestions, and also read reviews about specific helmets.  A baby’s head is really small, so you want to make sure the helmet is a good fit.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Why do we have to be searched at the airport?\\n\\nAssistant: There are several reasons.  One is that there’s a concern that terrorists might be trying to hide weapons or other things in your luggage, so the airport authorities want to be able to inspect and detect these if they’re in your luggage.  Another reason is that in some cases passengers are trying to smuggle items through security to avoid paying the fees, so the security staff want to be able to inspect them, in order to make sure these things are bought, or the fees are paid.  And finally, there’s a concern that many passengers are bringing things like illegal drugs or other things that they don’t want others to know about, but for which the airport staff have a search warrant, so they can also perform a search if they have this permission.\\n\\nHuman: What else are they looking for?\\n\\nAssistant: Passengers and luggage are searched for several reasons.  One is to detect items that might be dangerous, like flammable materials that could start a fire, sharp objects that could be used as a weapon, or toxic or corrosive materials that could be used as a weapon.  A second reason is to look for things that are dangerous to the aviation system itself, such as explosives or devices that could damage a plane’s avionics or electronic systems.  Finally, passengers and luggage are also searched for security purposes, such as to detect electronic or chemical signatures that might indicate something like a bomb.  Passengers and luggage are also searched to detect concealed weapons.\\n\\nHuman: What sort of drugs are they searching for?\\n\\nAssistant: There are two different types of drugs that are searched for at airports.  One type are illegal drugs, such as cocaine or marijuana, and another type are legal drugs, which are drugs that are legal in some countries, but not in others, so they might be illegal for a passenger to bring into another country.  Some of the drugs searched for at airports are dangerous and illegal in some countries, but not others.  This can be confusing, so it’s important that if you are taking a legal medication that’s not legal in the country you’re traveling to, you should be aware of the laws in that country.\\n\\nHuman: What sorts of medications are allowed on the airplane?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I could list all the available operating systems for you, or give some general recommendations.  Do you want me to do that, or are you just looking for a rough answer, and will do more research on your own?\\n\\nHuman: General information and recommendations would be nice\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here’s what I can tell you.  You have a bunch of options, like iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, which are competing ecosystems with different strengths and weaknesses.  Each one works best for a particular type of person.  Let’s start with the general things I would recommend, and then I can break it down by ecosystem for you.  For example, I would recommend that you install a password manager to keep your passwords safe.  Another example is that I’d recommend a calendar app, which can help you schedule events and remind you of important ones.

Edward explains that he must drink human blood, but not kill humans, and so must avoid the smell of blood.

In some parts of the world, both men and women wear makeup, while in others it’s only women.  In most parts of the world, women are more likely than men to wear makeup, and I think some people view it as more appropriate for women than for men.  In some cases, there are certain makeup products marketed specifically to men, but I think the fact that they’re marketed specifically to men speaks to the popularity of the trend.\\n\\nHuman: What countries or cultures in the world is it acceptable for men to wear makeup?\\n\\nAssistant: You might be surprised to hear this, but some men in Asia, in particular in China, wear makeup.  You might also see it in Korea.  In Latin America, in some countries, you might see men wearing makeup, and in other countries, both men and women wear makeup.  In Europe, and also in the U.S., you might see some men wearing eyeliner and other makeup products, as well as women.  This is still fairly trendy, but it’s also something that some men are adopting, which might make it seem less odd.  A few years ago, you might have seen this more commonly, but I think it’s still something you might see now and then.\\n\\nHuman: Are feminized men considered more attractive in some asian countries like Japan?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I know if I need dental implants?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m going to interpret “dental implants” to mean “artificial teeth.”  In that case, implants are typically used to restore or replace teeth that have been lost through injury or decay, so I think the best approach is to try to find out how much tooth is left.  For example, if you were already wearing dentures, this would mean seeing if the dentist has records about the condition of your teeth.  Does that sound right?\\n\\nHuman: Yes, it does. What else can you tell me?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m going to guess that you’re hoping that I can suggest other evidence you might check, since the dentist’s records will be unlikely to be fully up-to-date, since they’re not actively treating you.  It’s a good idea to check in with your dentist if you can, but I can suggest some other things you could look into, if you’d like.  You can look in your mirror to see if your gums are pulling back, for example, or see if your teeth are sliding forward.  But these will only be useful for spotting problems if you are familiar with the “normal” state of your teeth and gums.  \\n\\nAnother option is to take a photo of your teeth and see if any gaps are apparent.  This is called “palpation”, and involves using a dental pick to gently pry your teeth apart.  A quick Google image search shows examples of the technique.  Again, this will only be effective if you have some idea of how your teeth normally look and feel.  \\n\\nAre these ideas helpful, or do you have any other questions?\\n\\nHuman: Okay, thanks for that information. Are there different kinds of dental implants?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

This game puts you in the shoes of Altair, an assassin who is working to discover his father’s killer.  At the same time, he’s working for an enigmatic character who might just be his father.  Altair travels through historical settings from the middle ages to the Renaissance, and he must try to blend into the background and not draw attention to himself.

In addition to providing a balanced diet and plenty of water, it\\u2019s really important to make sure your dog doesn\\u2019t develop a dependency on food that might become unhealthy.  The problem with feeding your dog twice a day is that it gives them access to free food, so they may just eat too much.  It\\u2019s helpful to weigh your dog and write down their daily weight, and you\\u2019ll want to gradually reduce the amount of food you give them, over time.  Also, some dogs may still try to steal food, or become more food-focused, if you don\\u2019t give them any access to food at all.  For example, your dog might steal food from the trash, and that could lead to serious digestive problems.  On the other hand, if your dog doesn\\u2019t eat enough, you may want to consider having a physical checkup or blood tests to make sure they don\\u2019t have an undiagnosed medical problem.\\n\\nHuman: It seems like food is all my dog ever thinks about!\\n\\nAssistant: Dogs are omnivorous, so like humans, they get a lot of energy from food.  It can be very natural for dogs to want to eat all the time.  The problem with giving them free food is that it can give them a bad relationship with food.  Eating a healthy diet that\\u2019s part of a balanced lifestyle can be a good motivator for them to stay engaged with you, since it can build social bonds, or encourage behaviors like walking or running.  They also need to learn to regulate their eating, so you should be careful not to overfeed them, or feed them too much.  That could cause them to be bored and look for other activities.  When they have too much energy, they might get into trouble, or destroy things around the house.  It\\u2019s usually best to avoid giving them things that make them even more food-focused, like certain treat-type foods, like kibble.\\n\\nHuman: I am pretty sure I am overfeeding my dog.\\n\\nAssistant: It sounds like your dog is a labrador, and labradors do have a tendency to be a bit large, so it\\u2019s easy for them to eat too much.  It can be helpful to take your dog to the vet regularly, or ask your vet to do weight-checks.  That can help you keep track of their weight, and make sure they don\\u2019t get too large.  But if they are a bit chubby, it may be helpful to cut back on their food.  They will get used to it, so it\\u2019s helpful to be gradual.  To do this, you should take the amount of food you give them, and cut it in half.  Over time, that will help them eat less, so you can give them less food each day.\\n\\nHuman: A beagle.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I pitch a tent?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh gosh, tent pitching is a challenge! There are several variations on the way a tent can be set up, depending on the terrain and your needs.  Here\\u2019s a link to a guide with some advice for beginners, and I\\u2019ve also written the information I know into a simple set of steps:\\n\\nFor pitching a tent, we\\u2019ll need to buy the tent itself, a tent pegs, rope, and other smaller equipment like a shovel.  To get started, unroll the tent onto the ground, and use tent pegs to secure the ropes to the ground.  Then use ropes to tie the two sides of the tent together.  Next, fasten the ropes onto the tent pegs.  You can do this by bending each rope to reach the bottom of the tent, and then tying it.  Now you can stand up the tent.  You should use pegs to keep the side walls from blowing in.  Finally, set up the interior of the tent, and you\\u2019re ready to go!\\n\\nCan you tell me about something you were stuck on, or a time you had to figure out something?\\n\\nHuman: What is the shovel for?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, I thought I would wait for this!  A shovel is a tool for digging holes, and in this case, the holes you\\u2019ll be digging are for the tent pegs.  Remember how the tent can also be put up on the side of a hill, so you need to dig down and anchor the tent pegs in that way?  The soil here can be very difficult to dig into, but the blade of the shovel is strong and makes it a lot easier.\\n\\nHuman: I see, how about if the pegs keep coming out of the ground?\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.3622], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9594], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9686], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_rejected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9943], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9928], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9935], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pairs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If you carry your phone in a pocket or a purse then you probably want a case.  But if you only need a phone for quick interactions, a case may actually cause more harm than good.  What do you need the phone for?  Are you a parent, or do you work from home?\\n\\nHuman: What harm could it do?\\n\\nAssistant: A phone case can damage the screen, for one thing.  It can also get you in trouble if you have your phone turned off for some reason.  Then you will turn it back on and it won\\u2019t do anything.  If you can afford to replace it, then you need a case to protect it.  The problem is that most people aren\\u2019t able to afford to replace their phones all the time.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks for letting me know.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: What are some shows I might like if I like Friends?\\n\\nAssistant: \\u201cFriends\\u201d is one of my favorite shows, and here are some other sitcoms I think you might enjoy: \\u201cThe Big Bang Theory\\u201d (\\u201cfour really smart guys and the woman who loves them\\u201d, which is also a lot of fun), \\u201cHow I Met Your Mother\\u201d (\\u201can A story about friendship\\u201d), and \\u201cArrested Development\\u201d (\\u201cthe conceit is that the B plot isn\\u2019t plot, but that it\\u2019s the other way around\\u201d).\\n\\nHuman: What is Arrested Development?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you choose a new roommate?\\n\\nAssistant: That\\u2019s a tough one, because of how it involves what we would call \\u201ctaste\\u201d -- the innate sense of what is pleasing to the eye, or at least, to a certain set of senses.  It might be more honest to just say \\u201cyou\\u2019ll have to talk to others for their advice on this\\u201d.  However, I will try to offer some guesses at what might be involved.  \\n\\nFirst, if you\\u2019re looking to room with someone on a long-term basis, you probably want to choose someone compatible in terms of personality as well.  One of the first things you\\u2019ll notice about a person is their body language, and the way they look, for example in facial expressions.  How they react to things in conversation can give you a sense of whether you like their temperament.

              "[{'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you choose a good daycare?\\n\\nAssistant: In the United States, we generally use a system of “matching” parents to daycare centers.  In other places, you might instead go to a daycare center and ask around, or ask for recommendations from friends and neighbors.  Daycare centers have their own methods, too.  They might simply rely on how the kids do after a visit, or they might take a holistic approach to child care, with developmental considerations as part of the mix.  Overall, this is a tricky decision!  People tend to feel very attached to their children and their particular childcare providers.  It’s also hard for providers, because they are caring for lots of children, and it’s hard to make every one of them feel well cared for.  It’s also hard to assess how “good” someone is at caring for children, and it’s really difficult to tell from just one visit.  All in all, it’s important to find someone you like, and feel comfortable with, and that the kids like.  If you feel that you are not receiving what you need from a childcare provider, or the kids aren’t happy there, it’s probably time to look around and try somewhere else.  But if you\\n\\nHuman: Yes you definitely want the kids happy and well cared for.\\n\\nAssistant: Absolutely!  But a few more points about how to go about that.  There is a lot of variety in the kinds of daycare centers you can find, and in how they function.  For example, some are open to new parents just showing up, and others require an interview or paperwork beforehand.  Some offer set schedules that work for working parents, while others have a flexible approach to hours.  Some daycare centers emphasize quality food and education, while others have a more relaxed atmosphere, or more toys.  Some daycare centers focus on developmentally appropriate activities, and others take a more old-fashioned, baby-oriented approach.  For some, the focus is on childcare while the parents are at work, and for others, it’s on family time after the parents come home.  Daycare facilities are also diverse in who is allowed to attend.  Some daycare centers are open to children of any age, while others are open to children only, or are open to certain age groups only.  Daycare facilities can differ in whether or not they allow siblings.  It’s also worth noting that how well they work with each child depends on the child.  Some children seem to do well almost anywhere, and others\\n\\nHuman: There is a lot to consider.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Do you want them browned on the outside and inside or in the middle?  Would you like them sautéed in butter or oil?  Some people like them smashed with a fork.  Some like them chopped into cubes.  To make homemade hash browns, you’ll want to use either russet potatoes or potatoes of any variety, peeled and shredded.  Toss them with melted butter and a mixture of garlic and cilantro, or a mix of salt, pepper, and flour, and gently press them into a hot skillet.  Cook on both sides until they’re golden brown and crispy.  Serve with your favorite toppings, such as salsa, ketchup, or guacamito.  I recommend sautéed mushrooms or caramelized onions.  If you want to make them smashed, you’ll want to use a grill or a large cast-iron skillet, and mash them with a fork until they’re fairly well broken down.\\n\\nHuman: I prefer hash browns that are thin and crispy.\\n\\nAssistant: You’ll want to start with a large skillet on the stove, melt some butter in it, add garlic and cilantro to taste, and cook the potatoes in the melted butter and seasonings until they’re tender all the way through.  Then you’ll want to transfer them to a baking sheet, and press them down firmly into a thin layer.  Place the baking sheet into a preheated 400° oven, and cook until the potatoes are browned and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.  Be sure to keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.  Serve them hot out of the oven.\\n\\nHuman: How do I shred the potato to form the hash brown? I need to use a grater, right?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

First, there are different settings to choose from on your camera, and one of them is the “shutter speed”.  Shutter speed is how fast the camera takes the picture, and a slow shutter speed is less than 1/15 of a second.  Now, when taking pictures with less light, you’ll probably want to set the shutter speed to a higher number, like 1/25.  When taking pictures in a dark room, you’ll probably want to set it to 1/60.  And for a bright room, you’ll probably want to set it to 1/125.  A setting of 1/125 is considered a slow shutter speed, and you’ll use it when you want to blur the background of a picture.  If you’re taking a picture of a friend, you might want to use a very fast shutter speed, since they’ll probably be moving a lot.  A good setting would be 1/250.\\n\\nHuman: What about when taking a picture with a phone?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The symptoms appear to be similar.\\n\\nAssistant: The most common symptoms of the coronavirus, commonly known as “COVID-19”, are a fever, shortness of breath, and a dry cough.  This can sometimes progress to a sore throat, nausea, chills, and fatigue.  It’s likely that someone with these symptoms will test positive for COVID-19, so it’s a good idea to contact your medical provider if you are concerned.  Of course, the symptoms for the flu are also similar, and both illnesses often show up around the same time of the year.\\n\\nHuman: It is difficult to distinguish between the flue and COVID at this time of the year since it is flu season now.\\n\\nAssistant: In your case, the primary reason for seeing a medical provider if you’re having difficulty breathing or have a fever or cough is to make sure you do not have COVID-19.  However, you’re correct that the symptoms for the flu and COVID are similar.  Both infections can cause fever, cough, or shortness of breath, and while some individuals also show signs of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, these are less common.  If you are exhibiting these symptoms, you should see a medical professional as soon as possible.  In general, it’s always a good idea to see your medical provider if you’re feeling sick, especially if it’s a symptom that lasts more than a couple days.\\n\\nHuman: Pharmacies are supposed to have COVID test kits that you can do at home but no one has them in my area.\\n\\nAssistant: This is a tough situation.  It’s possible that your medical provider can test for COVID-19, but it’s important to remember that they can only do this in special cases, as we want to limit exposure for both patients and providers.  Fortunately, there are other ways to diagnose COVID-19, although there are still some limitations.  The most convenient way is to take a swab from the back of your nose or the back of your throat.  These samples can be sent to a laboratory for analysis, and the results should be available within 3-5 days.  Of course, these samples also require special care in handling.  In addition, you can find instructions online for doing an at-home nasal or throat swab, if your provider will send you home with the swabs and related instructions.\\n\\nHuman: My medical provider does not have it either.  What company manufactures COVID test kits that can be done at home?\\n\\nAssistant: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a website with information about COVID-19 diagnostic testing, including information about COVID-19 test kits.  If you are having difficulty breathing or have a fever or cough, you should see your medical provider as soon as possible.  However, if they are unable to perform COVID-19 testing for any reason, there are some resources that can help.   The main one that comes to mind is a self-testing kit manufactured by First Response, which is sometimes available in pharmacies.  However, these test kits are currently only available at certain locations in the US and through pre-order.\\n\\nHuman: You did not answer my question.

You can do this by downloading the installation files from Microsoft’s website, or by purchasing a disc that contains the older version of Windows.  Downgrading will allow you to resume using an older version of Windows that has fewer advanced features, while still maintaining all of your existing files and settings.\\n\\nHuman: How do you get a disc from Windows?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do they make new soda without any calories at all?\\n\\nAssistant: The most common way to achieve that is through the use of a blend of several sugar substitute compounds, which together have a calorie content of zero.  These compounds do have several undesirable properties, though.  One of these is the sweetness that they impart can actually be slightly too sweet, and another is the perceived metallic aftertaste that these sweeteners sometimes have.  When these compounds are added to existing soda, the balance between these properties is harder to get right, and this sometimes leads to a reduction in consumer satisfaction.  Therefore, soda producers usually prefer to avoid these compounds, when they can.  Instead, they generally prefer to use artificial sweeteners that do not have any aftertaste.\\n\\nHuman: So it is the sugar that is the main calorie in soft drinks?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, sugar is the main calorie in soft drinks.  It may seem surprising at first that these non-caloric sweeteners have an aftertaste that can actually be slightly too sweet, but this is due to the fact that these compounds have an effect on human taste buds that isn’t fully understood.  Specifically, the compounds in question are chemically similar to the amino acids that make up the protein used by your taste buds to detect sweetness.  We don’t yet know exactly how these compounds disrupt your body’s ability to recognize this protein, but it is believed that this accounts for the slight sweetness that they impart.  \\nWe are still not completely clear on the effects of these compounds on human metabolism, either.  While they can impart no calories, it’s unclear whether they also have a very low or no metabolic impact of their own.  One possible explanation for this is that some of them do induce some effect in the body, while others are perhaps not that much different from your natural body processes.  The effects of these compounds on blood sugar and other metabolisms in humans have not yet been fully explored, but it’s been shown that they induce many of the same reactions in mice, which raises some concerns\\n\\nHuman: Sugar has a lot of calories?\\n\\nAssistant: Actually, it’s the human body that converts sugar to calories.  In its most common form, sugar is just a carbohydrate, which is a single molecule made up of several smaller units of matter.  When you eat these molecules, your body converts them to glucose, which is the form that your cells can use to generate energy.  The molecules that make up glucose are composed of a group of smaller molecules called “carbohydrates”.  Each of these carbohydrate units is made up of a single “sugar” molecule.  For this reason, sugar can be used as a unit of measure for carbohydrates.  \\nHumans, however, convert sugar to calories at a rate that is completely dependent on your body’s metabolism.  Different people and different animals have different metabolic rates, which is why different people need different amounts of food.  For example, children need more calories than adults because their metabolism is much faster.  On average, your body’s metabolism will burn through 50-100 calories for every gram of sugar that you eat.\\n\\nHuman: Wow that is crazy!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

We can say that the usual techniques are to start out early, and introduce specific skills a little bit at a time.  We think it’s a great idea to let a child try things on their own, so they get a feel for it, but make sure you’re there to offer guidance if it turns out they need help, and of course they should always ask for your help if it seems like something is going wrong.  Also, it’s always a good idea to show a child how to put the tools away when they’re done.  When they’re ready to try something new, they should ask for your help to learn how to do it.  Of course, it’s also important to make sure the tools are safe for a child to handle.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, any other advice?\\n\\nAssistant: It might also help to be clear about what kinds of tools there are.  For example, there’s hammers, which are used for driving things in, and screwdrivers, which are used for turning things.  Knives can be used for cutting things and the table saw for cutting things into parts, but obviously you need to teach a child how to use them in a safe way.  That’s pretty much the long and short of it.\\n\\nHuman: Any other tools?\\n\\nAssistant: The nice thing about working with tools is there are so many different ones to choose from, it’s hard to know where to start!

We also think it’s a great idea to point out how tools often work together as a team.  For example, you might use a drill and a screwdriver to build things together.  We’ll also try to show you how the tools can be used to create parts that go into building more complex tools.  We’ll let you know more about this as you start building things yourself.

There are numerous dining options and gift shops available in the Grand Canyon Railway station that have some unique gifts. \\nThe Grand Canyon Railway runs from Williams, Arizona to Grand Canyon National Park in the eastern part of the state.  The ride from Williams to Grand Canyon takes approximately 3 hours.  The return trip is 6 hours, which includes time for a lunch break and a stop at the National Geographic Visitor Center at Grand Canyon.  When visiting the Grand Canyon Railway, you will not only get to see some beautiful scenery,\\n\\nHuman: Do I need to drive to Williams from Phoenix to catch the train?\\n\\nAssistant: Well you could, or you could take a bus to Grand Canyon, and take the train from there.  But first, here’s some more useful information.  There is a bus that runs between the Grand Canyon and Williams, and there’s also an Amtrak bus that runs between Grand Canyon and Williams, so it’s pretty convenient if you don’t want to drive.  The bus takes about 90 minutes, and tickets are $40.  If you get off at Williams you could just walk to the train station, since it’s right downtown.  Also, I saw on a review that it’s only $30 to park at the Grand Canyon National Park, so it’s pretty cheap to park if you just want to explore for a bit and don’t want to take the train.  Maybe you want to rent a car in Phoenix and drive to the Grand Canyon and take the train, if you’re just going for a day or if you need to go to Williams and don’t have a bus option?\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me about the accommodation in Williams.  Are there many hotels or motels there?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

If you see a dog choking, the first thing to do is to make sure it’s not just swallowing too big a piece of food.  If you think it might be choking, you need to check for a blockage or to see if it’s breathing normally.  You need to check for the presence of a foreign object in the dog’s throat or airway, and if you find something, you need to remove it.  If the dog is indeed choking, the next thing you need to do is make sure it’s on its side, in a safe position, and not upright or on its back.  You want the dog to be on its side with its head lower than its tail, and you want to be there with the dog, making sure it stays in that position.  Then you want to make sure its mouth is open.

If you find something in the dog’s mouth or throat that seems like it shouldn’t be there, you want to carefully remove it.  You want to make sure it doesn’t move around in the dog’s mouth or throat.  You might want to keep the dog from moving around by holding the dog, or you might want to tie the dog down, or put it in a cage.  If the dog is choking, you want to make sure it stays on its side in a safe position.

My own podcast was the first I’d ever done, and I was quite overwhelmed for the first few months.  Second, if you are able to get some support, then I’d recommend researching what equipment you might want.  You’ll need a microphone for your podcast interview, and a professional-grade mic is definitely recommended, especially if you’re trying to get good audio for listening on a podcast player (but it’s also useful for making an audio file that you can share).  In terms of publishing, you can use something called “podbean” to host your podcast.  They have an easy-to-use self-publishing interface.  You’ll need to pick a name for your podcast and write a description, and then you can upload audio files with a podcast host like Pond5.  I would encourage you to record a new episode of your podcast at least once a week.  It’s been very valuable for me to keep that regular schedule, so that I always have a backlog of episodes.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have a checklist of all the equipment needed for a podcast?\\n\\nAssistant: My checklist is mostly about marketing and scheduling.  I try to have a podcast episode that is ready to record and publish at the start of each month, with a planned recording schedule, so I’m ready to publish at least one episode each week.  I aim for a 50-minute episode, about 6-8 minutes of intro and wrap-up, and 40 minutes of content.  You’ll also want a backlog of episodes, so that you don’t run out of ideas and have to sit through some boring episodes.  Another helpful idea is to create a list of questions that you can use for your podcast interviews.  A good list for a podcast interview might include one question about your interviewee’s personal life, one question about the context or content of their job, and one question about their future career goals.  By asking the same basic set of questions to a lot of people, you can keep your content fresh while keeping the interviews fairly short.\\n\\nHuman: What equipment do I need?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Swaddling helps soothe the baby by providing comforting warmth and security, and also helps reduce the risk of infant sleep-related injuries such as SIDS.  You should swaddle the baby loosely enough that the arms and legs have room to move freely, but securely enough that the baby stays warm and feels snug.  Some parents also like to give their babies a pacifier or soft toy to swaddle with them, to provide extra comfort and security.\\n\\nHuman: How do I arrange the cloth?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The country was initially governed by a congress based in Philadelphia, then a constitution was created.  The country has been at war with Great Britain for much of its history.  During the Civil War, a few Southern states seceded from the country, eventually forming the Confederacy.  The Confederacy fought to preserve slavery, which was abolished soon after the war.  There was an economic downturn in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but the country began to industrialize after World War II, eventually becoming the most powerful country in the world.\\n\\nHuman: Can you name the 13 colonies?\\n\\nAssistant: I think there were 13 in 1776, and the original 13 Colonies were: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and New Hampshire.  But some states have since split off from other states, so New York and New Jersey are now separate states.\\n\\nHuman: Was George Washington the first President?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s right.  He became President in 1789.  He was followed by John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who was in office from 1801-1809, then James Madison.  James Monroe became President in 1817, and he was followed by John Quincy Adams in 1825.  In 1829, Andrew Jackson became President and led the Democratic Party.  He was followed by Martin Van Buren in 1837, and James K. Polk in 1845.  There was a civil war in the country for over four years, which ended with Abraham Lincoln being elected President in 1860.  He was followed by Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Ulysses S. Grant in 1869.  Andrew Johnson was replaced by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877.  James Garfield was the president in 1881, but was assassinated in 1881.  Grover Cleveland was president from 1885-1889, and Benjamin Harrison from 1889-1893.  Grover Cleveland was President again from 1893-1897, followed by William McKinley in 1897.  McKinley was assassinated in 1901 and was followed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, who had a big impact on the United States.  He was followed by William H.

For example, you might say to them, “You need to get up in the morning at this time, or I will remind you, and I will come into your room if I have to.”  After that, when it’s time for them to get up, you could have a ritual with them, like a light breakfast together.  \\n\\nIf they’re still having trouble, it could be helpful to create a reward system.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Is there a scientific, biological or evolutionary reason why so many poisonous and venomous bugs, insects and reptiles are found in Australia\\n\\nAssistant: I’m glad you asked!  Australia is an isolated continent, surrounded by ocean, and with few land bridges, so it evolved over hundreds of millions of years in relative isolation from other life on Earth.  This isolation allowed many species to adapt to local conditions, and “co-evolve” with Australia’s unique biota, so to speak.  When animals evolve on islands or in other isolated places, some of them can develop a unique mixture of attributes, a set of evolved behaviors, that can help them survive on that island.  Ecological diversity on an isolated island is much higher than on continents or larger islands, which makes it possible for animals to develop a wide variety of adaptations.  Australia has a rich biodiversity, with a large number of endemic species, including some dangerous bugs, and venomous snakes, spiders and reptiles.  Also, Australia’s isolation may have enabled the rapid evolution of poisonous animals in some instances.\\n\\nHuman: Why is ecological diversity higher on an isolated land mass?\\n\\nAssistant: One way to understand this is to think about how small animals evolve on islands, or isolated land masses, like Australia.  Smaller islands have fewer predators and more prey species than larger islands or continents, and so have more ecological diversity, or a larger number of species living together.  In Australia, there are few large predators that eat most of the small animals.  For example, the platypus is a large, egg-laying mammal, but it has few predators, and Australia is the only continent that it lives on.  Australia also lacks most of the dangerous predators from other continents, like crocodiles, great white sharks, and venomous snakes, which might be deadly for tiny animals.\\n\\nHuman: I read that Australian biodiversity has been influenced by the diversity of environmental conditions and characteristics like nutrient-poor soils, natural climatic variability, high fire frequencies and a generally flat topography.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: What is the purpose of daylight saving time?\\n\\nAssistant: Daylight saving time is actually not a law, but a common practice observed by many people throughout the country.  The goal is to help everyone get more sleep, and also to make sure everyone is protected from later-rising sun in the summertime.  Daylight saving time begins the second Sunday in April and ends the first Sunday in November.  During this time, we change our clocks so that everyone gets an extra hour of sleep in the spring, and an hour is subtracted from their morning in the fall.\\n\\nHuman: When did daylight saving time start?\\n\\nAssistant: Daylight saving time has been observed since World War II, though before that time, the practice was less widespread.  The federal law authorizing daylight saving time took effect on the last Sunday in April, in 2005.\\n\\nHuman: I heard that daylight saving time saves energy. Is this true?\\n\\nAssistant: Daylight saving time is observed by many people throughout the country, and is an important practice for conserving energy.  The reason for this is that during daylight saving time, many people sleep an extra hour in the spring, and an hour is subtracted from their morning in the fall.  This helps everyone get more sleep, and also ensures everyone is protected from the risk of waking up to a rising sun.  Because people are getting more sleep, they are often healthier, and also in terms of energy use, we all turn off lights and appliances more often in the evenings during daylight saving time, and also use fewer lights and appliances during the day in the spring.  So, both of these factors can help us conserve energy.  And similarly, many people also turn off their lights and appliances more often during the morning hours in the fall, to help conserve energy.\\n\\nHuman: Are there any states that do not practice daylight saving time?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Here’s what we know, based on the scientific research.  Although people have been seeing and reporting sightings of large, bat-like creatures for centuries, these reports are almost always followed by the creature’s disappearance or sudden vanishing.  This suggests that the creatures were probably all sightings of one or more exotic or unknown species of large birds of prey, or occasionally birds of prey that are more commonly seen far away from humans.  Based on those historical sightings and on the bones that have been unearthed, a number of species of large birds have been suggested as possible dragon sightings.  Other kinds of creatures that have been suggested as sightings of dragons, such as snakes, lizards, or monkeys, have not been confirmed as real.\\n\\nHuman: What about Komodo Dragons?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I decorate a Christmas tree evenly?\\n\\nAssistant: It depends a little on the size of the tree, but the key is to start with a single base layer of ornaments, then work your way out from the center in both directions to make sure everything is evenly spaced.  You can also add extra ornaments at intervals along the way to fill in any gaps.  You want to make sure the entire tree has an even distribution of ornaments, and the base layer should also be as even as possible.  There are several ways you can do this.  You can either put the ornaments in a circle around the tree, or you can space them evenly across the branches of the tree.  Then you can start from the center and work your way out.  If you do it from the center, you might want to start with a ring of ornaments, and add one or two more to each side at various intervals around the tree.  Then you can put one or two ornaments on each branch, working your way out from the center.  You can also add a few ornaments as you go, to fill in any gaps.  If you start with the ornaments in a circle around the tree, you might want to space them out from the center to each end of the tree, and\\n\\nHuman: How many lights should I put on a 4 foot tree?\\n\\nAssistant: You might want to put on two or three strings of lights, depending on whether you want the tree to look more bright or more minimal.

If you want it to be a bit brighter, you might want to put on three strings of lights, spaced evenly around the tree.  You can also choose to put on one string of lights at the top of the tree, and another string of lights on the bottom of the tree.\\n\\nHuman: I heard 100 lights per foot of tree.

A faster heart rate leads to a higher need for blood oxygen, so the heart is trying to push more blood around in order to bring more oxygen.

They spread disease, they’re obnoxious, and they suck.  I can share a few different things I’ve tried that might help you.  One really old-fashioned method is to collect the scum that forms on a lake surface.  You can collect it and mix it with water to make a kind of “bug juice” to spray on your skin, and this should be pretty effective.  On a more modern note, mosquitoes have ultra-sonic hearing, so if you play music on a really high frequency like 8 kilohertz, they can’t hear it and will stay away.\\n\\nHuman: What is a good all natural repellant for mosqitos?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

For example, the mutation of the gene that is responsible for the color of your eyes is an autosomal dominant trait.  This means that if you inherit two alleles for brown eyes, you will have brown eyes, and if you inherit two alleles for blue eyes, you will have blue eyes.  So basically, if both your parents had brown eyes, you’d inherit the brown-eye allele from both of them, and have brown eyes.  However, if one of your parents had brown eyes and the other blue eyes, the brown-eye allele would have to be dominant over the blue-eye allele to give you brown eyes.  This allele is found on chromosome 7, and it is found in approximately 20% of Europeans but less than 10% of Africans.\\n\\nHuman: Why is Europe more genetically diverse than Africa?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You’ll also need a mixing bowl, a rolling mat, a bamboo mat, and a baking sheet or tray, and a stove.\\n\\nHuman: What kind of fish do you recommend for sushi?\\n\\nAssistant: I recommend blue fin tuna.

You can roll the sushi in the sheet, but it’s best to lightly spread it out on a cutting board so that you can easily grab and cut the pieces you need.

Do you have any advice on that?\\n\\nAssistant: Alright, well it\\'s important to remember that there isn\\'t really a \"cure\" for scars.  If a scar is formed, it\\'s going to be there forever.  But I can give you some advice on what to expect from the process of trying to fade a scar.  The first thing to do is to figure out what the scar is formed from.  Depending on that, there are different solutions.  Usually scars are caused by injury to the skin.  If that\\'s the case, there are a number of things you can try to help heal the wound.  If you\\'re injured and then later you start to develop a scar, you can also try acupuncture.  This won\\'t work for the newborn scars that you can\\'t treat like this, though.  In addition, you can try to cover the scar with makeup.  There are some makeups that actually contain aloe vera.  Aloe vera is a plant, and its gel is particularly good at healing scars and preventing scarring.

I’m not sure if you’re looking to potty train your child, or if you want me to help you with it, but I’ll be happy to offer advice.  I can tell you that this is something you can do with a child as young as two.  Just like other behavior, your child learns it through repetition and practice.  You’ll want to teach your child to use the potty, before you do anything else.  So, start by taking your child to the potty about once an hour, after eating, drinking, and napping.  It’s important to be consistent with this.  Don’t let your child hold it, as this can cause constipation and irritable bowels.  And while you’re teaching your child, make sure you ask them if they’re trying to pee or poop and when they’re done.  Finally, make sure you put your child on the potty before any other activity, so they’re getting used to the feel and sounds of it.\\n\\nHuman: When is a good age to start teaching him to be potty trained\\n\\nAssistant: Most children are ready to be potty trained between ages 18-24 months, so it can take a bit of time to get them accustomed to the idea.  But a good rule of thumb is if your child can walk and communicate, they should be able to be potty trained.  You can help the process by taking your child to the potty often.  Make sure they know what it’s for.  Also, make sure you have some toilet paper on hand.  When they do use the potty, tell them they did a great job, as they may not feel it yet.  Take the training seriously and be patient with them.  Good luck!\\n\\nHuman: How long does it usually take to learn?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

We expect that the water will freeze inside the pipes.  The water pressure inside the pipes will try to push out the ice, but the effort needed to push the ice far enough will be too much, so the ice will thicken and slowly fill the pipes.

If you don’t drive a car, you can opt out of paying for one.  If everyone who didn’t drive one car or take a plane trip didn’t pay for any vehicle-related infrastructure like toll roads or plane tickets, this would amount to $1 trillion a year, money that could go to something else like better mass transit or making green energy cheaper and therefore more accessible.

In most cases, antibiotics will help resolve the problem, and people can recover fully within a few weeks.  Some people, though, are more susceptible to complications.

Such complications can be life-threatening, so it’s important that people contact a medical professional as soon as possible if they experience these symptoms.\\n\\nHuman: Can anyone get it or is it mostly the elderly?\\n\\nAssistant: Generally speaking, people who have a weakened immune system, or who don’t live in a good environment, are more at risk of complications.  That includes people with any chronic illness, as well as people who have smoked or used drugs.  It’s also more common among people who are overweight or obese.  Many of these people may not have a weakened immune system, but just eat too much sugar, fat, and salt, which is similar in some ways to smoking.

              " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: How can I start a fire without lighter fluid?\\n\\nAssistant: You can use a fire starter, which is a bit like a magnifying glass that concentrates the light of the sun to start a fire.  Or you can build a small fire with some dry sticks and pieces of dry grass or leaves, then use some dead plants or branches to get it going.  Or you can use two sticks to rub each other, until friction heats them up and causes a spark, which can then be used to start the fire.  Or you can light a fire by using a piece of cotton wool dipped in gasoline.\\n\\nHuman: I don't have gasoline, but I'll try the sticks. But how does this start a fire? How does it work?\\n\\nAssistant: You should carefully choose the kind of sticks that are flammable, and avoid any branches that aren’t completely dry.  And then take one stick in each hand, and move them so that the tips are close to each other, but not touching.  Then use a sawing motion to move the sticks back and forth rapidly, so that they rub each other and produce heat and friction.  That heat and friction can then be used to ignite a fire.\\n\\nHuman: What would be good kindling to rub the sticks over?\\n\\nAssistant: You can use any dry kindling, such as small dry twigs or leaves, dried grass, or thin pieces of cardboard.  Make sure it’s completely dry, or you won’t get a fire.  To check if the kindling is dry, first turn it over and tap it with your knuckles; if it doesn’t crumble or make a sound, it’s probably too damp to be used.   You’ll have the best chance of a successful fire if you use the smallest, dryest kindling you can find.  To keep your sticks from overheating and breaking, it’s best to use several small sticks that can all be manipulated easily.  But only rub the sticks together when you’re sure the tips are just about to touch.  If you do this correctly, the tips will become red-hot and start to glow and spark.  When you see the sparks and hear the clicking sound, quickly dip a bit of cotton wool in gasoline and place it in the flames.  This will produce a quick burst of fire, which should be enough to start your fire.\\n\\nHuman: Will the leaves not catch fire if I pull it straight from the tree?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

What is the origin of hummus?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not sure where it was first invented, but hummus has been popular for many centuries, and is originally from the Middle East.  It’s made with ground chickpeas, and may have a very different taste depending on the region where it is eaten.  In the Middle East, it is commonly made with sesame paste and tahini, which are both made from ground sesame seeds, and with cumin, cayenne, and a few other spices.  In the United States, there is often a lot of garlic in it, and sometimes fresh lemon juice or other acidic ingredients.  People use hummus in many dishes as a sort of “dip”, like you mentioned, and also as a base for salads.  Some people also put hummus in a blender with other ingredients, such as feta cheese, tomatoes, or pine nuts, and that creates a “hummus dip” or “hummus spread”, which can then be used as a kind of dip for other things.  In some places in the Middle East, there are dishes that are simply prepared with ground chickpeas and nothing else, as a main dish, so it is not always eaten as a “dip” or “spread”.\\n\\nHuman: I found this information online:  \"That being said, though, based on historical information, hummus likely originated from ancient Egypt.\"  Is this fact correct?\\n\\nAssistant: I found a Wikipedia article about hummus that says that early sources in Egypt mention a bean paste made from garbanzo beans.  The theory that this is hummus is based on evidence from early papyrus rolls, which include a list of foods called the “Love Letter Papyrus”, which appears to contain the word “hummus”.  Also, garbanzo beans are called “ful” in early Egyptian texts.   But it’s certainly not clear if this paste is the same as what is now known as “hummus”, and there’s debate about the translation of the word “hummus”, and also some debate over whether the word “ful” really does mean “chickpeas”.  It’s possible that people in ancient Egypt did make a paste from beans, which they then ate as a spread, but we can’t be certain if it’s the same as the dish called hummus today.\\n\\nHuman: Are chickpeas and garbanzos the same thing?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

There are lots of paths to a college degree.  It’s especially common if someone started a career before they finished high school, and wants to return to school.  In fact, that’s been a common pattern for generations, and has helped bring us to our current point.\\n\\nHuman: Do they need to have at least a GED to enroll?\\n\\nAssistant: In my experience, there’s no official prerequisite for enrolling in college, as long as you’re over the age of 18, and it depends on the institution.   The key question is usually just, “do you have the required courses?”  For example, if you need algebra, you might need to retake high school algebra.  You can also usually substitute for any math courses that are prerequisites for a degree with AP tests.  The same is true for any subject that is a required for a degree, such as English or history.   If you need to take classes to get up to speed in order to apply to college, there are various online resources you can use to quickly get a handle on whatever subject you need.\\n\\nHuman: Well what about placement tests?

So, for example, if there’s a sensor or part that needs to be changed, they can change it from the ground.  Or if they want to add a new sensor, they can add it remotely.  They have all kinds of tools for doing that.  Of course, they still need to physically put the sensors in place on the spacecraft.  So they do need to put some equipment in space.

To go downhill you usually use the brakes, which are the least powerful way to go.  To go uphill you usually use the gas, which is the most powerful way to go.  So if you can’t brake very well, it’s better to shift the car into neutral and let it roll down the hill.  This helps you avoid sliding backwards, which would be even worse than going forward with the ice.  As for shifting into neutral to go uphill, that’s something you only really need to do when you’re on really steep hills and can’t get the car going fast enough with the gas.  You might still be able to go up a steep hill by going slower than you normally would with the gas, or even letting off the gas and steering in the direction you want the car to go.\\n\\nHuman: So neutral helps slow you down?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The side you are facing as you work on the scarf is the “front”, while the side you aren’t looking at is the “back”.  In order to “knit an infinity scarf” you need a circular knitting needle and some yarn.  You will also need a “knitting bag” for storing your work and keeping your stitches untangled.

You can take turns reading them together as a family.  If you’re reading a story, it can be helpful to stop every few sentences and take turns describing what you imagine what’s happening and why the characters are doing what they’re doing.  You can also explain the larger themes or moral of the story, or what questions it might raise for them.  And you can also talk about what the characters might be feeling or thinking, or how the scene might have affected them.  When you find something that catches your attention, you can stop to read it again a couple times, or ask some questions about it.\\n\\nHuman: All right, those are great tips. Do you have any more?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, if you’re interested in helping your children take a more active role in learning to read and interpret texts, you could also have them try reading a few verses out loud.  If they’re having trouble, you can read alongside them for a bit and help.  When they’re feeling more confident, you could also ask them to describe the story as they read, or to start asking questions like those mentioned above.\\n\\nHuman: Is memorization important?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

They might not even be aware that they’re doing something helpful for themselves, or that they’re using a specific technique.\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me about some specific techniques or strategies?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure!

Mnemonics are memory tricks you can use to remember something.  For example, “Alliteration” is a common mnemonic, where you use a rhyme or alliteration to help you remember something.  For example, we might have a mnemonic that says: “Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain”.  By rhyming “Richard Of York” with “battle”, and repeating this, we would create the memory association that “battle” is a synonym for “York”.  This is because we first connect the rhyme, then realize that the rhyme means “York” in “Richard Of York”.\\n\\nHuman: Are there any supplements or foods that are good for memory?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

That\\'s because the injection won\\'t affect your blood sugar, but the glucose in your bloodstream will be slowly absorbed by your tissues and over time it should lower your blood sugar level back to normal.

However, the only one that might work for you is with a type of pump that sits on your skin.  This pump pushes insulin into your skin through a tube attached to a small plastic piece in your stomach.  These pumps are new, and have only been available in the US since 2015.  They may have a low failure rate and be more convenient to use than injections.  They also may be better for people who can\\'t use the injections.  You can call around to find out if there is a local health center that offers the pumps.  If not, you may have to order one online.

He is an American, and has been a professional player since he was in high school, which is an unusual choice for a very talented high school student. He is named after his father who, ironically, played college basketball at a small university in North Carolina, and had a short stint in the NBA, before being drafted for military service in Korea. But he suffered a significant shoulder injury that ended his basketball career, and led to a long and painful recovery process. He ended up working in the tire business, until the family suffered economic hardship, and he took a job as a sportscaster.\\n\\nHuman: Is there anyone else more famous than Michael Jordan in basketball?\\n\\nAssistant: No, he is considered the best player of all time, and so no one is considered as successful as he has been.  There are some other very good players in the NBA.  This is because the NBA has a regular season where teams can play different players in different roles.  The season also has playoffs, and the best teams in the league are invited to the championship finals, which are held over several games.  To be the best player, you need to be able to play against different kinds of players, as well as having an understanding of what your team needs, and a good understanding of the game.\\n\\nHuman: Who is better, Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I use cruise control in a car?\\n\\nAssistant: Cruise control is very handy, and can help you drive in a less distracted, more pleasant way.  But, before you start using cruise control, make sure you’re completely comfortable with how it works, and make sure you can switch to manual control easily.  Also, while on cruise control, make sure to focus fully on the road, and drive at a safe, consistent speed.  After you are satisfied that you can drive safely with cruise control, if you want to try it, the process is simple.  Just select “cruise control” in the control panel of your car.  Cruise control works best at constant speed, with no sudden braking or acceleration, and with the road relatively straight.  Cruise control can also be used on roads that have hills, but it is less effective and may require using the brakes.  \\n\\nAfter you are satisfied that cruise control is working well for you, you can try to automate the cruise control if you’re on a highway or empty road where there’s no traffic.  To do this, just press the “resume” button on the cruise control.  The cruise control will resume driving at the speed you set, and you can let go of the controls and enjoy the\\n\\nHuman: Do I start it before I get to the speed I desire?\\n\\nAssistant: If you want to let the car do the driving for a while, you can set it to “resume” on the cruise control while still on the highway, or before you reach the speed you want.  It will then start driving at the speed you set, and stop when you press the resume button.  After you press the resume button, you can set a new speed and let the cruise control resume again, and the car will automatically begin driving at the new speed when it reaches that speed.\\n\\nHuman: But that only works after I  had a previous speedset.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I’ll try to give you a simple and direct explanation, using words you know.  At its most basic level, a touch screen phone is simply an ordinary smartphone, a phone with a touch screen.  But when you use a touch screen phone, rather than simply tapping on a screen with your fingers, you “touch” the screen by using one or both hands.  So, one hand is the “main” hand, while the other is the “secondary” hand.  When the main hand “touches” the screen, this is called the “touch.”  The touch can be “detected” by the phone.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. But how does the screen sense where your finger is in order to know where you're touching it?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, it does this by detecting infrared light.  When you use your finger to touch the screen, it blocks a portion of the light waves from the screen that are bouncing off of your finger.  So the phone has infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and infrared sensors in the screen that can “see” your finger and the blocked light.   There’s also another technology, capacitive sensing, which detects the capacitance of the skin of your finger and its dielectric properties.  These also work, but infrared sensing is easier.\\n\\nHuman: Is capacitive touch screen technology used more than infrared sensors now?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, that’s right, there are more capacitive screens than infrared screens now.  In terms of the newest smartphones, almost all of them have touchscreens that use capacitive technology.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Can you tell me more about capacitive screens? I want to know more about the most modern touch screen technology.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

It has one side that comes up about a foot off the ground, and another side that goes down into the ground.  The sides are separated by a narrow chute.  The trap has an entrance on one side, and a lid on the other side.  You place bait (like stale bread) on the entry side, and close the lid.  When the frogs enter the trap, they swim in and get stuck in the trap.  Then you can remove the trap, empty it of frogs, and return it back into the garden.\\n\\nHuman: Can I make one of those?\\n\\nAssistant: You can certainly try.  You’ll want to make sure the sides are sealed properly.  In addition, you’ll want to make sure that you don’t have any gaps in the sides, so that the frogs can’t escape.  You’ll also want to make sure that the entry side isn’t too large, so that they can’t crawl in.  And you’ll want to make sure that the exit side isn’t too small, so they can’t back out.  Finally, you’ll want to make sure that the device isn’t too deep in the ground, so they can’t get stuck in the trap, but also so that the sides aren’t too high off the ground, so they can’t climb out.\\n\\nYou can buy the traps online, or you can visit your local home improvement store and find something like this.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, is there any other way I can keep them out besides a trap?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The Amazon rainforest is definitely the main attraction, and it’s something that a lot of people feel lucky to have visited.  You can see the rivers and experience the jungle on a river cruise through the Amazon Basin.  I’ve heard good things about Rondônia National Park, which has some of the best areas for hiking and horseback riding in the Amazon.  One of my favorite cities to visit in Brazil is Florianopolis.  It’s in Southern Brazil, and it’s a small city, but it’s very beautiful and offers some really good food and nightlife.  I also really like the beaches in Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro, the world’s most famous.

I’m pretty sure that’s all the information I’ve heard about Nauru.\\n\\nHuman: Where did the country get its independence from?\\n\\nAssistant: Nauru achieved independence from Australia.  It had been under Australian administrative control since 1892.  Although in the modern context it is now officially an independent country, I’m guessing that it is still heavily influenced by Australia, since Nauru is still a member of the Commonwealth and most Nauruans speak English.\\n\\nHuman: Is it located near Australia?

Its other neighboring countries include Micronesia to the west and Kiribati to the north.  The capital of Nauru is Yaren, and the official languages are Nauruan and English.  Nauru has a humid tropical climate, and the economy is based on fishing, tourism, and phosphate mining.\\n\\nHuman: Do you know that the Republic of Nauru is the ninth smallest country in the world?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

If so, this should be fairly straightforward.  All you need to do is take a bit of kindling, and scrape a sharp edge of the flint against the kindling until it starts to smoke and glow red hot.  Once you see that red glow, you’ll want to gently blow the glowing embers, and once they are glowing brightly, you can then blow them more forcefully, and add on your kindling.

She’s credited with suggesting the idea of a federal anti-poverty program to her husband, which became known as the “War on Poverty”, and she campaigned extensively for the program after his death.  She then helped secure passage of the National Institutes of Health Act (1968), which eventually led to the founding of the National Cancer Institute.  After that she co-chaired the president’s Task Force on Mental Retardation, which recommended the founding of the “Eunice Kennedy Shriver Act” (1970), which led to the establishment of the Special Olympics.

As a suggestion, I’ve found that one thing many people agree on, is that the original Super Mario Bros. is a classic!  It is extremely easy to pick up and play, and it’s also very fun.  This is a great choice if you want to get a good Mario game with a long, varied gameplay.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds like a good one. I will try that.

              " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: Can a building collapse out of nowhere?\\n\\nAssistant: A building can collapse in a number of ways.  For example, if it’s old and not built very well, a building can collapse due to forces that are normally non-existent.  If it’s brand new and perfectly constructed, a building can collapse due to intense forces, such as an earthquake.  If it’s new but made using faulty techniques, a building can collapse for a number of reasons.  In the USA alone, nearly 200,000 buildings in the modern era have collapsed due to faulty construction.  It’s important that any buildings in earthquake zones are designed to withstand the forces of earthquakes, since an earthquake can also cause buildings to collapse.\\n\\nHuman: What other outside forces can cause a building to collapse?\\n\\nAssistant: Many of the reasons for the collapse of buildings are related to human activity.  For example, a building can collapse if there’s a fire, if there are safety hazards inside the building, if there’s a flood inside the building, and so on.  But in the USA alone, nearly 200,000 buildings have collapsed over the last 50 years due to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes.  These disasters are entirely due to forces of nature that have nothing to do with human activity.  These forces can also cause a building to collapse, and this is why it’s so important to design buildings to withstand these forces.\\n\\nHuman: Can a building collapse without outside forces affecting it?\\n\\nAssistant: Technically, a building can collapse due to its own weight, though this is extremely unlikely.  Sometimes, a building is so poorly constructed that it becomes structurally unsound due to the building’s own weight, and this can cause the building to collapse.  It can also happen due to a number of other factors, but these all still depend on forces that would normally not affect buildings.\\n\\nHuman: Can you give me an example of when that happened?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, that’s an interesting story.  In 1981, the factory in Beech Street in Gillingham, England collapsed.  The reason the building collapsed was because the factory owner had put in a brand new concrete floor without an adequate support structure.  The concrete floor was supposed to support the factory’s heavy machinery, but because the owner didn’t provide a proper foundation or support structure for the floor, the building itself began to collapse.  To make matters worse, this happened right when a business meeting was taking place at the factory, and 60 people were inside.  Because the building started to collapse from the inside, the people inside didn’t have much time to react, and because of the gravity of the collapse, they were crushed by debris as the building collapsed.\\n\\nHuman: I don't think the World Trade Center fell because of a fire and flood. Didn't two planes fly into it to cause the building to collapse?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

First, use a damp rag to remove the dust that might be on your floor.  Then, wet the rag with the solution and rub the solution into the surface using short, firm strokes.

A sauna uses both heat and steam to create a hot, humid, and energizing environment.  It is a popular feature of many spas and gyms, but also some homes have built-in saunas.  Saunas are a bit like a small hot tub, and in a sauna you would often lie in a bed of heated rocks.  Saunas are a little bit like a hot yoga class, and at the same time they are also a bit like a steam room.  In a sauna you might exercise by doing light stretching or gentle movement, or you might simply relax in the hot, steamy environment.  A sauna can help relax your muscles, your body, and also can help your mind unwind from stress.  They are also a good way to help you stay healthy, as they can help you sweat, which can help your body release built-up toxins, and they can help you breathe in some clean steam.  If you regularly take saunas, you might notice some health benefits, such as they might help you feel more relaxed and also you might notice some physical benefits, such as they might help you stay more healthy and also\\n\\nHuman: If I were to put one in my home, how much room would it take?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

The 13th Floor was a 1963 book, and this is probably the one I would recommend most as an introduction to his work.  In that book, the protagonist is a man who is kidnapped and taken to a building where he encounters the same sort of evil things that we’re familiar with in the movie I Am Legend.  It’s actually a great depiction of the building’s walls and corridors, and how claustrophobic and isolating they are, so that it feels like a different world.  \\nRichard Matheson wrote many other horror novels, including I Am Legend and The Incredible Shrinking Man.  This story is a real chill, especially in this idea that he is in this dark environment, and his family goes to find him.  He’s on the 13th floor, and there is no 13th floor, but somehow he’s still there.\\n\\nHuman: What is The Shrinking Man about?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a fun story that is so memorable, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to have the ending we expect.  This book is so famous, and if you haven’t read it, I really encourage you to do so.  You will see some examples of claustrophobic situations, but even though that’s a theme in the book, it’s mostly about a man who tries to escape from this plot to kill him, while he is shrinking.\\n\\nHuman: Should I read The Shrinking Man or I Am Legend?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

There are so many factors that can impact how you’ll like a wine, and having the right glass can make the difference.  Are you familiar with the typical wine glass?\\n\\nHuman: Yes. Okay, what should I use a sherry glass for?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, sherry, delicious!

Do you have another example for me?\\n\\nHuman: Which glass do aperitifs go in?\\n\\nAssistant: If I’m thinking about aperitifs and digestifs, in general they’re a light-bodied wine, like a dry white or dry rosé.

You can also encourage them to practice wiping several times each day, and remind them to wipe thoroughly to prevent germs and infections.  It’s also important to teach them to wash their hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, since this helps prevent infection.

The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite indices are restricted to large-cap companies, meaning ones with a market capitalization of at least one billion dollars.  The Russell 2000 and Wilshire 5000 include small-cap companies, with market capitalizations under a billion dollars.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: What exactly is the placebo effect?\\n\\nAssistant: The placebo effect is a pretty complex and controversial topic, so I’ll try to explain it as clearly as possible.  The placebo effect happens in clinical trials and also in some everyday situations.  In a clinical trial, the placebo group can actually get better if they think they’re taking a real treatment, and the control group can also get better if they think they’re taking a placebo -- but neither one knows for certain whether they’re taking the real drug or the placebo.\\n\\nHuman: It sounds like the placebo is a \"mind over matter\" situation where people can actually react if they think they\\'re taking something that will help them. How is that possible, that our mind and psychology can control our bodily reality?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it seems like it’s a combination of both mind over matter, and also our belief can influence our body.  The placebo group receives some real treatment, often some placebo pill, so they get some real medical care, and then they also often think they’re taking some special \"medicine\" or treatment.  So they might expect it to work for them, they might believe it will work, and their mindset and belief can also influence their body.  And similarly the control group can also sometimes get better if they think they’re taking a placebo, and believe it will help them, so it can work both ways.\\n\\nHuman: When was the placebo effect first introduced in serious medical trials?\\n\\nAssistant: The placebo effect seems to have been noticed in serious medical trials in the 1940s and 1950s, and really become a big topic starting in the 1990s.  So this is still kind of a newer phenomenon, although it’s something that’s been known for many years, at least in some informal situations.  And it seems like it started becoming a bigger topic in scientific research in the 1990s.\\n\\nHuman: The earliest I read was 1799.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Use a rag or paper towel to spread a small amount of toothpaste onto the surface of the shoe.  If they are really dirty, you will see the toothpaste becoming incorporated into the shoe surface, and they will start to look clean.  Now, take a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush and start applying small, gentle strokes in the direction of the shoe surface.  The toothpaste should be spread out thin enough that it's making contact with the shoe surface, and also it should be contained within a boundary, rather than soaking into the shoe.  This helps it stay put, and it also makes it easier for you to spread it in even strokes.\\n\\nNow, start gently stroking back and forth, in the direction of the shoe surface, to work the toothpaste in.  Continue to stroke in the same direction until you've made it look like they're really clean.\\n\\nNext, you want to make sure they're really clean.  Gently set the shoe down on a flat surface, like a countertop or a table, and start applying pressure in the direction of the shoe surface with a separate finger.

One way is to eliminate the source of the mold, like a leak in your roof, or a flooding basement.  You could also install some kind of mold-fighting device, such as a dehumidifier, or an air purifier.  That can help prevent mold growth.  You can also use bleach or vinegar to kill existing mold.  \\nIf you have mold in your walls or ceiling, you might want to try scraping it off with a putty knife, or prying it off the surface with a screwdriver.  Make sure you wear protective gloves and a facemask.  This is actually something you want to do on a regular basis, because even if you temporarily get rid of the mold you see, it will probably come back again.  If you see mold growing inside a wall or in a ceiling, you\\u2019ll want to call a professional to take care of it for you.  They might need to open up the wall or ceiling to do the job right.  \\nIf you have mold growing in your yard, you\\u2019ll want to try to get rid of it by scraping it off the ground, or by pouring vinegar right on the ground to kill the\\n\\nHuman: Open up the wall?\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9937], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9925], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9933], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_rejected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9661], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9223], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9756], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pairs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For example, if you experience pain or a feeling of illness.   The doctor will be able to listen to your heart, and look at your skin and inside your eyes, and make sure you’re healthy.

As a baseline, humans also seem to sleep more than our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos.  But humans also seem to be particularly good at resisting sleep deprivation, which means that they also seem able to make themselves go for longer periods of time with less sleep than other species.  \\n\\nIt’s also not clear how much sleep we actually need.  It’s not necessary for health, and some studies suggest that many human adults could go without much sleep and remain healthy.  But human adults still appear to do better on cognitive tests if they have 8 hours of sleep, compared to 4 hours, and human adults also tend to prefer longer sleep durations than shorter ones. \\n\\nThe question of how sleep evolved in humans has been a topic of interest since the 19th century, and there have been many theories for how the biological features of sleep and sleeplessness evolved to fit together.\\n\\nHuman: So other mammals need about the same amount of sleep as we do?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Making your own cookies from scratch gives you a fresh batch that’s completely customized to your own preferences.  You can add nuts or chocolate chips or whatever else you want into the batter, and you know exactly what’s going into the cookies.  So it’s a great way to control the quality of the cookies you eat.  Also, if you make your own cookies, you can buy an inexpensive cookie sheet and a inexpensive baking stone, and make a homemade cookie sheet mix, which is also inexpensive.

This is tricky.  You want her to get all of the academic benefits of skipping a grade, but also not to face a steep challenge that she isn’t emotionally prepared for.  I think that you’re absolutely right to have some concerns here.

If you are looking for a soy-based sauce, I would suggest it is made with thick soy sauce and not, for example, any type of teriyaki sauce.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Why do people get sunburns?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s because there are rays of light in the sun that are strong enough to penetrate your skin.  These rays of light are called UV rays, and you don’t want them to get inside your body because they are harmful to your cells and DNA.  When you get in the sun, the rays of light hit the top layer of skin called the epidermis, but they are blocked by the bottom layer of skin called the dermis.  However, you need these rays of light to produce vitamin D, so your body is clever: if it starts to run out of vitamin D, then you start to make more melanin.  This is a chemical that darkens your skin, like a sunblock, and in this way you block some of the harmful rays.  However, if you stay in the sun for too long then the melanin can’t catch up and you get a sunburn.\\n\\nHuman: Is it better to just stay indoors and eat vitamin D pills than go out and get sunburned?\\n\\nAssistant: Well it’s good to remember that vitamin D is a really important nutrient, so it’s better to get it from the sun than to take it in a pill.  However, most of the time you can avoid getting sunburned by staying out of the sun, even for short periods.  So you could take vitamin D pills instead of going out in the sun, and as long as you stay out of the sun, you should be fine.\\n\\nHuman: Sometimes it is hard to get enough sun.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

At the end of the 1990s, the Clinton administration was making progress on a peace plan for the Middle East.  The plan called for a gradual pullout of US troops from Saudi Arabia, a recognition of Israel’s right to exist, and a “land for peace” arrangement whereby Israel would gradually withdraw from the West Bank.  In 2000, George W. Bush was elected, and the peace process ground to a halt.  During the 2000 campaign, Bush made it clear that he would pull the US out of the Middle East, and make it a priority to do so.  The human rights situation in Saudi Arabia was also getting worse, and Bush promised to take a harder line on human rights there.  But he never actually followed through.  In addition, the Bush administration made a series of deals with the Saudis that seemed to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses there, and also to involve the US in ongoing support for the Saudi regime. \\n\\nOnce Bush was elected, there was an immediate shift in US policy.

The vacuum can be connected to a hose that goes outside, so that the dust and dirt can be sucked outside.  Inside, the dust and dirt are carried into a removable bag.

The majority of its population is of Malay descent, and Malay is Brunei’s official language.  The capital city of Brunei is Bandar Seri Begawan, or “BSB” as it’s often called.  BSB is located on the north coast of Borneo Island, about an hour’s drive from the South China Sea.  BSB is also the only place where the Malay language is legally required to be spoken, although English is widely understood and spoken as well.  In BSB, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs all have their headquarters there.\\n\\nHuman: How did the kingdom start?\\n\\nAssistant: The Sultanate of Brunei was established in the year 1839 by Tuanku Syed Putra Jamalulail, the 18th Sultan of Brunei, after decades of civil wars.  The first Sultan was known to be very loyal to the British Empire, especially to the British East India Company, and his rule was very successful in stabilizing the kingdom.  In the 20th century, a series of events led to Brunei becoming a country with almost complete political and economic independence.  In 1906, Sultan Muhyiddin Abdulaziz Al-Mu’izz, the 29th Sultan of Brunei, issued an English-language proclamation that introduced reforms, including the abolition of slavery, payment of wages to government workers, and the right to religious freedom for non-Muslims.  Sultan Muhyiddin died in 1946.\\n\\nHuman: Where does this country get revenues?\\n\\nAssistant: Brunei is a constitutional monarchy, meaning that the Sultan of Brunei is the head of state and that the people elected representatives of parliament, or “Dewan Undangan Negeri” in Malay, have significant influence.  The most important sector for the Brunei economy is the oil industry, which accounts for about half of the government’s revenues.  The government of Brunei also runs a national sovereign wealth fund known as the “The Brunei Investment Agency”, which was formed in 1983.  The fund has about US$3.3 billion of assets under management as of 2015, and its board of directors is appointed by the Sultan.  In addition to government oil revenues and the profits from the BIA fund, Brunei’s economy is also dependent on the earnings of large oil companies such as British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, and Brunei Shell Petroleum, as well as mining companies such as Tin Ore Manufacturing\\n\\nHuman: Is Brunei a member of OPEC?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

In addition to providing a balanced diet and plenty of water, it’s really important to make sure your dog doesn’t develop a dependency on food that might become unhealthy.  The problem with feeding your dog twice a day is that it gives them access to free food, so they may just eat too much.  It’s helpful to weigh your dog and write down their daily weight, and you’ll want to gradually reduce the amount of food you give them, over time.  Also, some dogs may still try to steal food, or become more food-focused, if you don’t give them any access to food at all.  For example, your dog might steal food from the trash, and that could lead to serious digestive problems.  On the other hand, if your dog doesn’t eat enough, you may want to consider having a physical checkup or blood tests to make sure they don’t have an undiagnosed medical problem.\\n\\nHuman: It seems like food is all my dog ever thinks about!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

However, not everyone has access to vaccinations, not everyone would be willing to wear a mask, and there are other factors such as risk-exposure in public spaces and potentially not every case is Covid-19.

Some people just don’t understand how it works or trust the government.  And some people think the government is lying.  It’s hard to say why people believe what they believe.

But unfortunately, the rest of the cells that chemotherapy doesn’t target are also often killed by the drugs, especially healthy cells with a similar DNA structure.  And this can lead to many unpleasant side effects.\\n\\nHuman: So someone going through chemotherapy usually has a tough time.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, because chemotherapy affects the whole body.  It makes you tired, and gives you unpleasant side effects like nausea, vomiting, and hair loss.  It also leads to loss of appetite, which is common, and can become dangerous over time.  And while chemotherapy can sometimes get rid of a cancer, it is a tough treatment.  Overall, chemotherapy is definitely very unpleasant.\\n\\nHuman: How long does a person have to go through chemotherapy to get rid of the cancer?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I know if I need dental implants?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m going to interpret “dental implants” to mean “artificial teeth.”  In that case, implants are typically used to restore or replace teeth that have been lost through injury or decay, so I think the best approach is to try to find out how much tooth is left.  For example, if you were already wearing dentures, this would mean seeing if the dentist has records about the condition of your teeth.  Does that sound right?\\n\\nHuman: Yes, it does. What else can you tell me?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m going to guess that you’re hoping that I can suggest other evidence you might check, since the dentist’s records will be unlikely to be fully up-to-date, since they’re not actively treating you.  It’s a good idea to check in with your dentist if you can, but I can suggest some other things you could look into, if you’d like.  You can look in your mirror to see if your gums are pulling back, for example, or see if your teeth are sliding forward.  But these will only be useful for spotting problems if you are familiar with the “normal” state of your teeth and gums.  \\n\\nAnother option is to take a photo of your teeth and see if any gaps are apparent.  This is called “palpation”, and involves using a dental pick to gently pry your teeth apart.  A quick Google image search shows examples of the technique.  Again, this will only be effective if you have some idea of how your teeth normally look and feel.  \\n\\nAre these ideas helpful, or do you have any other questions?\\n\\nHuman: Okay, thanks for that information. Are there different kinds of dental implants?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Also, a general eye exam for everyone is a good idea at least once per year as a precaution, even if there’s nothing wrong.\\n\\nHuman: Yearly, eh?\\n\\nAssistant: Right!

Most wired connections are wired right into your home, so you can be confident the connection won’t go down unless there is a problem with your router, modem, or other hardware.  Additionally, most wired connections are wired throughout your home, meaning the connection is consistent throughout.  You can also daisy-chain additional devices to your router if you need more internet capability or more storage.\\n\\nThe cons are that wired connections are not mobile -- if you want to connect to the internet from multiple locations in your home, you’ll need to have a wired connection to each location you want to access the internet.  Additionally, if you live in an apartment or other shared building, you may need to buy a router, modem, etc. for each device you want to connect, or you may need to talk with your landlord to setup a router in your unit that can handle multiple devices.  And if you ever move and want to keep your internet service, you may need to buy a router and modem to connect to the internet in your new home.\\n\\nHuman: Are wired connections faster or slower?\\n\\nAssistant: Wired internet is typically reliable and consistent, and also usually provides a decent amount of bandwidth.  That said, it can be slow if the network between your home and your provider is slow, or if you’re streaming video or using apps that require a large amount of bandwidth.  You can also create a wired network that is fast by buying a fiber network router, such as the Cisco 829 Wi-Fi Router (4G/8G, Fiber), which provides very high bandwidth and very low latency.  If you want a wired connection that can provide a lot of bandwidth to each device in your home, you might want to buy a router like this.  You can also buy a wireless network adapter for computers or other devices that connect to your router, which can provide a wireless connection to the internet that can provide a good amount of bandwidth.\\n\\nHuman: What I mean is, from the same provider, if I have a modem in my house, is wired generally gonna be slower or faster than using wifi on it?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The three rings are numbered 1-20, and the single bull’s-eye in the center is numbered 20.  If the player hits a single number on the board, they win the point, but if they land the dart on any other ring, they are supposed to move forward the same number of rings as the number that was hit.  If a player misses entirely, they are supposed to throw again.\\n\\nHuman: How many points do you get for hitting a regular number on the board?\\n\\nAssistant: If you hit a “single” then you get 1 point.

Many of these religions have experienced significant persecution at various points in history, but over the past few decades the government has generally sought to promote tolerance and equality.  Still, it’s important to remember that there are still some negative attitudes and prejudices toward some religions, especially in rural areas.  Also, it’s important to note that freedom of religion is not always the same thing as freedom from religion.  For example, in practice there are plenty of places where churches will refuse to marry a gay couple or a Muslim will be turned away from a hospital for refusing to accept blood transfusions.

You might also want to consider replacing some of your vegetable oil products with ones that are healthier, like olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and so forth.  Likewise, you want to make sure that you’re getting plenty of saturated fats from meat and fish, and also some vegetables like avocado, as well as some nuts and seeds, like chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts.\\n\\nHuman: Is there a recommended amount of trans fat you shouldn't go over per day?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Nebulizers work by a variety of methods, but most often they take a certain kind of treatment and turn it into a vaporized form that’s inhaled.  They can also work the opposite way, by a generator that creates a certain type of treatment gas.  The gas is then inhaled through a tube or nozzle that’s placed in the mouth or nose.  This process can help the user fall asleep, or it can provide some kind of treatment to the lungs.\\n\\nHuman: What age can kids use them?\\n\\nAssistant: I recommend nebulizers for kids starting at around 2 years old, and they can use them into adulthood.

This work included programs for machine learning and pattern recognition, as well as programs that produced responses based on logical reasoning and probabilistic inference.  The standard software libraries and toolkits that power artificial intelligence programs today, as well as a wide range of current applications and platforms, began emerging in the 1980s.  The field has since grown rapidly, and today there are many organizations dedicated to advancing AI research and applications, as well as a large community of developers who contribute to open source projects and other open source software tools used to build AI applications.

I’d be happy to share what is known.  \\n\\nAs a general matter, we know that male brains are slightly larger than female brains.  For a typical adult male human, the brain is about 10 to 12 percent larger than the brain of an average female human.  That’s an average difference, but the exact size can vary quite a bit -- male brains can be much larger than the average female brain, and female brains can be much smaller than the average male brain.  \\n\\nWe also know that male and female brains have different patterns of neuron distribution, or more simply, certain kinds of neurons are located in different parts of male and female brains.  The male brain is said to have more neurons, especially in certain regions, and on average female brains have slightly fewer neurons, and those that do exist are somewhat smaller than in the male brain.  \\n\\nBoth of these differences can have substantial effects on mental abilities, especially when viewed in the context of sexual dimorphism, or differences in size and structure between the sexes.  A male brain is somewhat larger than the female brain on average, and it can have a slightly larger number of neurons, and those neurons may be\\n\\nHuman: So how do these differences affect how men and women behave or think?\\n\\nAssistant: Although it’s definitely not known that a female brain cannot do the same kinds of things a male brain can do, or that the exact same neural configurations or activation patterns must exist for the same behavior to occur, there are some fairly general stereotypes about typical male and female brains that are used in several realms of discourse.  \\n\\nThere are stereotypes about the “male brain” being wired more for logic and reasoning and “the female brain” being more emotional and creative.  It is unclear to what degree these stereotypes are based in science and to what degree they are cultural stereotypes that actually happen to correspond to brain differences.  \\n\\nTo take a slightly more scientific example, there is fairly good evidence that a woman’s brain is more likely to become more active when presented with emotional information, compared to a man’s brain.  Does this mean that one of these brains is “more emotional” than the other?  Well, perhaps.  Perhaps women are more likely to be emotionally “scary” than men are.  Perhaps women are more empathic than men are.  There are some ideas about the potential for these differences to shape culture and society, but that may not be the only result.\\n\\nHuman: Yeah, I have heard about women not thinking as logically as men do.

Farmers can choose to grow GMO crops because the process is sometimes faster and less costly than using crossbreeding to develop non-GMO varieties, and GMOs often increase crop yields.  They have some benefits, but also some drawbacks.  \\n\\nGMO crops can help relieve poverty in countries that have been chronically under-nourished, but some critics argue that GMOs harm the environment, biodiversity, and the health of consumers.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. And what is the process of adding genes in gmo crops?\\n\\nAssistant: This is actually a complex subject, and there are some technical points that are difficult to explain in a relatively informal way.  To give you a simplified explanation that’s relevant to your concerns, here are some common ways that genes are added to crops:  \\n\\nGenetic engineering techniques can create a plant with multiple copies of a particular gene.  This technique is called “stacked” gene overexpression, and is often used for fast-growing plants.  You can think of stacked genes as sort of a “boost”.  For example, you could have two copies of a gene that controls the production of an enzyme that breaks down a pesticide, and you could then make a plant with the ability to better resist insect pests.  This technique is a kind of “supercharged” version of cross-breeding, but since the organism is genetically engineered, the process is often faster.  \\n\\nAnother technique is to introduce new DNA into a plant through the use of bacteria.\\n\\nHuman: What other methods are used to add genes to the organism?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

A major early center for coffee growing and roasting was New Orleans.

It was Nixon’s second time being elected to the presidency, having first won in 1960, after John F. Kennedy’s assassination.  But Nixon’s election also sparked protests from Americans protesting Vietnam War, civil rights, and the effects of the war on the economy.  In this political environment, Nixon began the administration known as the “Great Silence”, a period where he didn’t talk about the issues facing the nation and didn’t hold press conferences.  So while there was a strong opposition to his administration, there was no reliable record of what the Nixon administration actually believed and what actions it was taking.\\n\\nHuman: Was Nixon personally involved in the scandal?\\n\\nAssistant: Many scandals surrounded the Nixon administration.  The “Watergate scandal” is one in particular that involved a number of burglars breaking into the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C. during the 1972 presidential election.  One of the burglars was arrested and revealed a number of links between himself and the White House, which involved a conspiracy to cover up evidence of the Watergate break-in.  As it turned out, the burglary was committed by Nixon’s reelection committee, and evidence found in Nixon’s own handwriting was discovered that related to the Watergate burglary.  Nixon’s involvement in the scandal was the issue that finally forced him to resign from the office of the president in 1974.\\n\\nHuman: Was Nixon a good president otherwise?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The wifi in your home is normally handled by a piece of equipment called an access point, or wifi router.  When your wifi is slow, it may be that this device is far away from where you are, or that it is in a spot with poor wifi coverage.  The number of wifi users in your area can also be an issue: many users all using wifi at the same time can put more load on your router.  Additionally, your router might be old or damaged, and the wifi it sends out may have trouble passing through walls or thick floors.  If you have another router, you can place it near where you are, or near the weak spots you think you’ve found.\\n\\nHuman: How does my neighbor's usage of wifi affect my connection?\\n\\nAssistant: There are three ways your neighbor’s usage of wifi can affect your connection:\\n\\n 1. Your neighbor can be on the same wifi network, which means that if you use wifi, so can your neighbor.  In order to do this, your neighbor must be using a wifi network that is already open (there is no password to access it), or be able to connect to your router.  Some access points support a feature called WDS that allows a single access point to be used by many wifi devices simultaneously.  In a multi-user wifi network, your neighbor’s wifi traffic could overwhelm your access point.  To avoid this, you can ask your neighbor to disable WDS and pick a password for the network.\\n\\n2. Your neighbor can also use their wifi to share content, such as internet-connected television.  If your wifi is poorly configured, then you might not be able to access content from it, even if you can see it from your wifi.  If you are having trouble accessing content from wifi, then ask your neighbor to pick a password for the network.\\n\\n3.  Finally, if your neighbor uses your wifi to access the internet (not just sharing content like wifi-enabled tv), then their internet traffic\\n\\nHuman: Can my neighbor connect to my wifi network without a password?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

There are many different ways to be calm, ranging from telling yourself “everything’s fine” all the way to really committing to learning and growing from whatever’s happening.  There are lots of different ways to work on this.  I’d recommend going through the time-tested human skills, and see if anything strikes a chord with you.  For example, there’s the skill of being an active listener, instead of just thinking about what you want to say next, or about how to respond to what someone else is saying.  There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.  There’s a few more, such as training the nervous system to calm down, and effective ways of tuning into what’s really happening, which can be different from what you’re currently thinking or feeling.

It’s a little bit like taking a mental break from thinking about what you’re worried about, and just thinking about taking a relaxing breath, and focusing on relaxing all the muscles in your body, and doing whatever works for you.\\n\\nHuman: Okay so I need to try to be in full control of my thoughts and try to focus on positive things.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You could try pushing it with a tree branch or a piece of wood, or else digging it out with a spade or shovel.  If the car isn’t totally stuck, you could also try driving the car forwards or backwards very slowly, in order to rock it back and forth and out of the mud.

It will probably take some effort to rock the car back and forth enough to be able to drive it forward or backwards, and maybe your tires will only spin in the rut, if that’s where the wheels are in contact with the ground.  Another possibility is that the wheels are stuck in a hollow with mud.  This can make it harder to push the car forwards or backwards, because there might not be enough traction on the ground for the tires to have good traction.

They were especially afraid of federal laws or treaties that would destroy or weaken their way of life.  Desegregating schools would be perceived as an attack by the federal government on Southern way of life.

Before that, the swastika was used in India and also in other ancient cultures, but in a very different context.  Its original meaning was very positive and inclusive, and it was used as a symbol of peace and good fortune.  But the Nazis took the swastika and flipped its meaning on its head: they used it to represent racism, hatred, and violence.\\n\\nHuman: Why did the Nazis choose that symbol specifically?\\n\\nAssistant: The Nazis used the swastika because it seemed visually striking and also because they wanted to appropriate this ancient symbol and turn it on its head.  They thought it would make their flag and their movement seem strong and victorious, and also that it would send the message that they supported the opposite things the swastika originally stood for.\\n\\nHuman: I see.

So for now, don’t use weights at all, and I’d recommend starting off with leg presses and lunges and using only your body weight.  Then, try deadlifts or barbell squats as well, and use just your body weight as well.  Then, use heavier weights.  Each time you try a new exercise, start off light and use your body weight.  For example, if you try a new exercise that involves a barbell or dumbbell, start off with just holding the bar or dumbbell.

A person usually sleeps best when he or she is not too hot or too cold, and the goal is to find the sweet spot for maximum comfort.  Can you describe what your sleep schedule looks like and what you’re using as a bedding and sleeping surface currently?\\n\\nHuman: I have some blankets but they are not warm enough.\\n\\nAssistant: That’s really common, because blankets usually aren’t good for keeping you warm in the winter.  I recommend you get some additional blankets.  A regular blanket or duvet that isn’t designed for the winter would probably not be very effective.  There are products out there designed for the winter which have very different materials and properties.  For example, some have bamboo fibers, which are very warm, or down feathers, which are very light, warm and fluffy.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, anything else?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

These are sold at most auto parts stores, or you can buy one online.  They attach to the valve stem in the center of the tire with a screw.  You will want to set the pressure to the recommended amount (which will depend on the type of vehicle), and then check it often to make sure it stays that way.\\n\\nHuman: How do I add more air if my tire pressure is too low?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

A human in Florida might build a house to face into the sun, while a human in Scotland might build a house to face away from the wind.

The fossil record shows that human-like species have been around for at least 2 million years, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that modern humans have always been the same species that exists now.  Firstly, there are many different human-like species.  In particular, there was a species called homo erectus, which I think was around for something like half a million years.  These human-like species shared some traits with us, but had some significant differences, for example they were much larger.  In fact, for many millions of years we shared the earth with large human-like species that were our ancestors!\\n\\nHuman: How long have humans been reading and writing?\\n\\nAssistant: Good question!  This is also a tricky question, because the ancient humans that we share our ancestry with didn’t write anything down, and I’m not sure there’s any evidence that they used any writing systems at all.

Humans will often raise and slaughter animals for meat, which some people find cruel.  Modern laboratories have developed a few promising alternatives for this.  For example, cultured meat would grow tissue from stem cells taken from animals, instead of starting with whole animals.  Many people think that cultured meat is a more humane approach than traditional farming.  Could you tell me more about what you would like to know?\\n\\nHuman: Is it really safe to eat this type of meat?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes!  Laboratory meat grown from cultured cells will be a safe, clean alternative to the way meat is raised today.

They also described how its safety could be verified in future studies.  Could you tell me more about what you’re interested in hearing about?\\n\\nHuman: When is it estimated that this meat will be widely available?\\n\\nAssistant: As far as I can tell, cultured meat could be available as early as 2030.

It has two general functions.  One function is to mark the formal end of the Christmas season; people often celebrate Christmas and New Years on the same day, but the day after Christmas is considered to mark the end of Christmas, and boxing day celebrates that.  The second is to give people the opportunity to exchange gifts.  Traditionally it is a chance for family and friends to give and receive gifts, sometimes in the form of “Christmas boxes”, but this is no longer the case.\\n\\nHuman: When did this tradition start?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s a bit unclear exactly how far back this tradition goes, but it’s known to have been a part of the Christmas season since at least the 1700s.  There is a story that the tradition was created by a man named Henry Upjohn, a wealthy English banker, who gave the young servant boys who worked at his house a day off on December 26th each year to provide them an opportunity to exchange small gifts with their friends and families.  This would be unlikely to be what the earliest holiday was like though, since by the time Upjohn began the holiday in the 1700s, people would already have had at least one day to exchange gifts, in which case the holiday would have been about enjoying an extra day off and some rest.  This would also have been an entirely optional holiday, unlike boxing day, which has always been an important part of Christmas in the UK, not just something that is sometimes celebrated.  Though there is some evidence that Christmas and boxing day were only celebrated every other year, or occasionally skipped entirely, before the Industrial Revolution, when some people in the UK were rich enough to be able to buy a lot of gifts and wealthy enough to hire a lot of servants.\\n\\nHuman: Okay so, this was a holiday for the poor people?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I believe it’s a fundamental underpinning of our democracy.  We each have a civic responsibility to ensure that our government institutions operate ethically, and to participate in community activities to make our society better.\\n\\nHuman: What is ethos?\\n\\nAssistant: The word ethos can mean the general cultural beliefs, norms, and attitudes that characterize a society.  The civic mindset also reflects a general culture of integrity, honesty, respect for others, and responsible citizenship.\\n\\nHuman: Can ethos be transferred from one person to another?\\n\\nAssistant: Absolutely, we can all choose to adopt a civic mindset, and we can also share that mindset with others, and in turn be influenced by them.  Likewise, we can also take active roles in our community to help others adopt the civic mindset, or support our community.\\n\\nHuman: proxemics must play a part of a civic mindset in relation to influencing individuals.\\n\\nAssistant: I would agree.  The words we use, and the way we communicate can help influence others to adopt a similar civic mindset.  Likewise, I would recommend making choices that reflect this mindset, so that others might be influenced by you.\\n\\nHuman: Proxemics means social distance.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, you could think of proxemics as part of the larger civic mindset.  I would recommend that we all try to make sure our behavior is respectful and considerate of others, so we don’t put too much social distance between us.  Likewise, it’s a good idea to make sure we aren’t doing things that might violate someone else’s social space.\\n\\nHuman: when does culture become cult behavior?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer precisely, but I would say the difference between a healthy, mainstream culture and a cult is one of degree.  If a culture (whether it’s mainstream or a cult) starts pushing extreme or unreasonable boundaries, whether it’s physical or social, you might start to see cult-like behavior.  Likewise, if a culture starts pushing everyone too hard in one direction, it might also cross into cult territory.  So some people might argue that there are cultish aspects to our culture right now, or there might be cultish aspects in some fringe sub-cultures, but the mainstream culture doesn’t seem too out of line at this point.\\n\\nHuman: Cult behavior develops when personal boundaries have been eroded to a point where there is no proxemic space left. Like rats in a cage they begin to destroy one another.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Just ask your school for a glass jar that they’re discarding, then follow this tutorial to make your own cloud chamber.  If you want to see antimatter, just shine a light into the jar, and you’ll see the particles of antimatter (positrons) in the light beam (where the electrons would normally be).  You could also try demonstrating that light is not a wave, but a particle, by shining a laser at a white surface like a wall or a piece of paper.  The beam will produce a dot where it hits the surface, which is similar to how a tennis ball bounces when it hits the ground.  If you shine the laser through a screen made of two layers of black velvet separated by a small gap, you’ll see the single dot of light as a moving pattern.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds like a really fun experiment.

Men should keep their hair well-groomed and tidy.  The key word is tidy: their hair should be styled in a way that looks neat and pulled together.  A nice-looking man with neatly-styded hair will always look more put together than a man whose hair is disheveled or whose facial hair is too long.  Likewise, men should keep their facial hair well-groomed.  For most men in their 20s, that means they should shave at least once every couple of days, and ideally, twice a day.  Additionally, they should keep their facial hair short and well-trimmed, and maintain a neatly-groomed beard.  Most men with well-kept facial hair look more put together than men whose facial hair is either too long or too patchy.\\n\\nHuman: What about clothing? Does grooming encompass clothing, or is that more to do with style?\\n\\nAssistant: Grooming does encompass clothing: well-groomed men tend to wear clothes that are well-fitting and flattering, and that they care for and look after, and likewise, well-groomed men pay attention to their clothing choices so they always look pulled-together.  A man who is well-groomed will dress appropriately for the situation and the occasion, and also will tend to choose well-fitting clothing that complements his figure.  Likewise, he will pay attention to his clothing so it looks neat, clean, and tidy.\\n\\nHuman: Do women have the same grooming expectations of men, or do they have different standards of hygiene?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

A healthy dog should also get plenty of exercise, which can help promote normal growth and maintain a healthy weight.  Some adult dogs should eat slightly more than 1-2 cups of dog food per day, while puppies should eat slightly less.

              " {'prompt': '\\n\\nHuman: Please tell me about the history of country music in the United States.\\n\\nAssistant: Ok, here’s a quick overview of the history of country music in the United States:\\n\\n\\nSince the early 1900s, when “country” music began as early forms of country, folk, bluegrass, and blues, it has developed into one of the most popular forms of music in the United States.  It has provided a space for musicians and listeners to share their experiences of both the general life events of humans, as well as specific regional or cultural variations.  The name “country music” is a little complicated.  It initially applied to a style of music that drew from a variety of music styles, but the term itself, as well as the music, evolved over time.  Some of the most well-known artists in country music are Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, George Jones, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Dolly Parton.  Some of the most famous songs in country music are “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”, “Ragged Old Flag”, “Stand By Your Man”, and “9 to 5”.\\n\\nHuman: I remember Dolly Parton.  Is she one of the singers that made country music popular in the United States.\\n\\nAssistant: Dolly Parton is a popular American country music singer and songwriter.  She is credited with helping to create “Nashville sound”, which was a genre of country music that included pop, rock and roll, and other contemporary music styles, but with a strong country focus.  Parton was one of the first country artists to reach mainstream success, and is the only female artist to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Parton also has released many songs on her own, as well as writing for others, such as “Blue Smoke” by George Jones.  Her most popular songs include “Here You Come Again” and “Jolene” (a cover of a traditional song), and her most successful album was her self-titled album, which was certified diamond by the RIAA, for selling over ten million copies in the United States alone.\\n\\nHuman: Are you familiar with Keith Urban.  I thought he was from Nashville but he is from Australia.  He became famous in the United States.\\n\\nAssistant: That’s true.  It was actually in 2006, after a chance meeting with a record producer, that Keith Urban began his career in the United States.  Prior to this, he had been performing and writing songs in Australia, but had little success in his home country.  After meeting and befriending the record producer, Urban flew to Los Angeles and was immediately signed by the Curb label.  This was an unexpected opportunity for him, and the subsequent “beautiful coincidence” would lead to both his debut album and his rise to fame in the United States.  Urban was signed to an 18-album contract, and would go on to release his self-titled album, as well as “Ripcord” and “Defying Gravity”.  Urban’s style has been likened to both Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.  Urban is also known for performing several songs from popular movie soundtracks, including “You Look Good in My Shirt” from the film “Old School”.  Urban continues to be one of the most successful and popular country artists.\\n\\nHuman: When I was much younger, I thought liking country music was not cool.  However, now I listen to country music almost every day.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

              " {'prompt': \"\\n\\nHuman: What should you do if there's a grease fire?\\n\\nAssistant: Hm, interesting question.  First, here’s what a grease fire is.  It’s when a container or pan of cooking oil or fat has become hot enough to ignite, and it’s now burning.  If it’s a pan that’s at least partially covered in food, the flames may be visible as blue or green or just as a very hot flame.  A grease fire is much more dangerous than a typical home fire, since it’s more likely to generate a large amount of smoke, especially if it’s in a closed space.  It’s extremely important to get the fire out quickly, but also to avoid getting burned by it.  I could talk about what equipment and techniques I think are best to do this, but what I’d actually like to know is how you think you’d do it?\\n\\nHuman: What is the best technique to put one out if I don't have a fire extinguisher?\\n\\nAssistant: Well first, I’d say that it’s important to act quickly, and to put it out as soon as possible.  If the fire is small, an absorbent or even grease-blocking material, like a blanket or cloth, might be useful, but it’s important to avoid being burnt.  Many materials might work, including wet newspapers, a wet tablecloth or cloth, or even a towel.  This material should be positioned near the fire, not over it, since it’s flammable.  The fire may also burn through a grease-blocking material rather quickly.  If the fire is large, it’s likely to be more dangerous, and I would just avoid it until it goes out on its own.  I really don’t know of any ways to put out the fire safely from this distance, without first putting on some protective gear.  You should talk with the local fire department if it’s serious, and don’t use anything flammable like water or plastic to put it out.\\n\\nHuman: I see. What about throwing water on it?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

I’ve heard that adults often have a lot of extra baggage from our childhood, and that this can manifest as what’s called an “inner child”.  One way I’ve heard about to heal this is to practice “self-nurturing”.  The idea is that, much like a young child, our inner child often needs attention and care.  Self-nurturing is a practice where we give that extra attention to ourselves.  We might take time to relax, like when we are “doing nothing” on a vacation or weekend.  We might treat ourselves to some comfort food or a drink, or do something just for ourselves.  There are many ways to practice self-nurturing.  Do you have any questions?\\n\\nHuman: Got it. do you think meditation or journaling can help strengthen this?\\n\\nAssistant: I think it could help you to be better able to listen to your inner child, so that you can better understand their needs.  This could help you to give them more attention and care.  I don’t think meditation specifically is necessary to do this, though there are many kinds of meditations that can help.  Journaling can also be helpful, since writing is a way to give your inner child a voice, and it can help you reflect on how you are feeling and what’s happening to you.

It has decent support for the open-source web browser called \"FireFox\" but not great support for Google\\'s Chrome, Safari, or Opera.  That’s because of the way that the Kindle Fire tablet is built.

Horses, like many other domestic animals, tend to be wary and cautious of humans, and need to be trained and socialized.  You’ll want to start by learning how to approach and handle horses safely, by practicing with smaller and friendlier horses, and getting coaching on how to use the right equipment and safety equipment like helmets.  Then as you advance, you’ll want to work with different horses to learn what they respond to and what they don’t like.  Horses are creatures of habit and want consistency in their routines, so any effort you make to make a horse trust you will need to continue and build over time.  There’s also an additional issue, that many horses that are shown or ridden competitively are very attached to the people who have handled them, and their riders.  You might find a horse who is more friendly to humans when it’s ridden by its owner.\\n\\nHuman: This is a of information to take in.  So, it takes a lot of time?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

He was the 28th President of the United States and is sometimes called “The Father of the American Middle Class” because he supported raising the wages of working people, and this was a very progressive and progressive thing to do in that time period.  He also established the Federal Reserve and created the Federal Trade Commission.  As President, he was also strongly pro-League of Nations, which was an organization with the goal of keeping the peace in Europe, and he also led the US into World War 1, which is important because it helped bring an end to WWI, which is also a very important accomplishment, because WW1 had been happening for almost two years already, and the US hadn’t entered the war yet.  In the 1920s, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to bring about peace in Europe.  What else?  Oh, he was also friends with Margaret Sanger, who was a feminist and an advocate of birth control, and she also made sure that contraception was available to poor women through her organization, Planned Parenthood, which is also a very important accomplishment.

This is based on data that FAFSA has collected from all students applying for aid in the past, and their decisions are guided by a system set up to maximize the amount of aid each eligible student receives, while also minimizing administrative costs.

In some cases, it’s an issue of individual voter fraud, where a person casts a vote that they aren’t allowed to cast, or they make a false statement on a voter registration form.  In other cases, it’s an issue of systemic fraud, where there are major problems with our electoral system.  Right now, the biggest problems are that in many states, voter rolls are outdated, and there are concerns about the security of electronic voting systems.  But also, we’ve seen a number of incidents of voter fraud.  For example, a voting machine company called VR Systems was convicted of fraud for manipulating votes in several states, and individual people are convicted for voter fraud every year.\\n\\nHuman: Is it more Republican fraud or Democrat fraud?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

To mix the concrete, you’ll use a “power trowel”, which is a tool that has a handle and a circular trowel blade on the end of it.  Using this tool, you can mix the concrete inside the truck, as well as pour it out onto the wall or floor.  The most common brand of power trowel is Quikrete Power Rake.  You can find it on Amazon or Alibaba, or possibly somewhere else.  Is there anything else you wanted to know?\\n\\nHuman: How long does it take Quikrete to dry?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s a great question!  If you use normal Quikrete, it will normally dry within 24 hours of the final pour.  I’m not aware of any “special formula” or “fast drying” options that would speed this up any further.  However, you can speed up the drying time by spraying the concrete with water until it’s fully dry.\\n\\nHuman: What if I get it on my hands?  How do I get it off?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

They also learn that they have to get special treatment, and can’t learn to regulate their emotions, because that would make them normal.  So they become bullies, and then they get rewards from other people, so they get a false sense of what makes them special.

Does it all go to their parents?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, child actors often have agents, who negotiate contracts on their behalf, and then they get paid to the agent, who is responsible for paying the child.  Usually the agent will handle the money, and might also take a small percentage.  The amount they get paid depends on how famous they are, their age, and how many hours they work per week.  Child actors also need to be aware of and protected from potential exploitation, and that’s part of what agents do.\\n\\nHuman: But the child actors themselves don't get the money, right? Isn't it illegal to pay children for work? It has to go to their parents?\\n\\nAssistant: As I said, child actors are often represented by agents, and agents negotiate on their behalf.  But in many cases the parents of the child actor actually receive the payments.  The money often goes to the parents, to manage, rather than to the child, because of legal rules around how a child can work.  It’s often much easier to get approval to hire an adult, even with a minor character, than to hire a child.  But in cases where children are allowed to be paid, they are.

Some of the reasons for doing this procedure are to treat infections, chronic ear infections, and over-flaring of the eardrum caused by repeated minor trauma, such as through swimming, barbells, or weightlifting.  Tympanoplasty surgery involves reshaping the ear drum with a thin, solid piece of plastic, and is typically completed in about 30 minutes in the operating room.  You will not have any external scarring from the operation, which leaves the ear with a restored appearance, and normal, unimpeded hearing.  The tympanoplasty is a very common surgery for people who have experienced middle ear infections.

The country was initially governed by a congress based in Philadelphia, then a constitution was created.  The country has been at war with Great Britain for much of its history.  During the Civil War, a few Southern states seceded from the country, eventually forming the Confederacy.  The Confederacy fought to preserve slavery, which was abolished soon after the war.  There was an economic downturn in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but the country began to industrialize after World War II, eventually becoming the most powerful country in the world.\\n\\nHuman: Can you name the 13 colonies?\\n\\nAssistant: I think there were 13 in 1776, and the original 13 Colonies were: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and New Hampshire.  But some states have since split off from other states, so New York and New Jersey are now separate states.\\n\\nHuman: Was George Washington the first President?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

But in general, the reason indigenous populations did not develop large cities was simply that the way of life based on nomadic travel was more effective and sustainable, and they lived in an abundant land with plenty of resources to go around.

You can certainly make fruit wines or cider from any kind of fruit you like, and there are often local products or organic brands you can find that make wine from specific types of fruit.  But the majority of commercially-made wine comes from grapes.  Winemakers have to carefully control the processes and ingredients to ensure quality consistency, and this is easier if they use a fruit with a specific size and shape.

Any cable lock will offer this protection.  Alas, many cable locks are a pain to install, and the risk of being caught with your lock at the wrong angle prevents you from using it most of the time.  There are also mechanical locks, with a U-shaped bar that locks behind the front wheel.

These locks have a large key ring, so you can put it on a backpack.  The cable is thinner and more flexible than other cables.  This makes it less likely to damage your frame, even with a bit of force.  They’re fairly easy to use.  However, to prevent cutting through the cable with a bolt cutter, it’s good to have the lock set into a wheel.

Some guided meditations don\\'t have specific start and end times, and I have often found that it helps to do guided meditation on a routine basis, like a daily habit, because your brain learns to associate it with a time when it\\'s OK to get out of your thoughts and just feel peace.  When you\\'re having trouble falling asleep, you might focus on the guided meditation for a while and then just let yourself think whatever you want for a bit.

White noise is just like ambient noise in nature, but without the things you can usually hear, like birds chirping or wind.  You can use white noise to try to mask or \"blur out\" your thoughts.  There\\'s an app called \"Meditation Timer\" that I\\'ve used to help me relax before bed.  I\\'ll show you how you can use it to find a new time to meditate every day:\\n\\nYou can also try using nature sounds, which are much more peaceful, but also less helpful for blocking out thoughts.  Nature sounds tend to be lower and less stimulating, so they might help you relax more quickly, but they are also often more noticeable, and can become annoying if they continue for too long.  You can also use nature sounds to calm you down when you can\\'t sleep, or to help you fall asleep.  You might try them by themselves first, but they\\'re also a good addition to a guided meditation if you like them, because they\\'re easier to drift off with.\\n\\nHuman: What do you think about using a weighted blanket as well?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The idea is that you contribute money into a retirement fund every year, and you aren’t taxed on that money as long as it’s invested.  When you retire, you can take money out of that account tax free.  There’s also a cap on how much you can contribute to a 401k.

Can you explain credit cards to me and what some of the important features are?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, I can help you understand.  There are several things that can be confusing.\\n\\nHuman: What is the interest rate on a credit card for?\\n\\nAssistant: Interest on a credit card is the cost that you pay to use the card.  The rate is expressed as a percentage of the total balance you owe.  So if your card charges you 2% interest on balances, it means that for every dollar you owe, the credit card company will charge you 20 cents of interest.\\n\\nHuman: Ok then, what is a reasonable interest rate for a credit card?\\n\\nAssistant: The most common interest rates are 11% for consumer credit cards and 15% for secured credit cards.  These rates are reasonable to the card issuer, because it’s their money.  Your total balance is usually a fraction of the interest you pay on that balance.  So the cost to you to borrow that money is higher.\\n\\nHuman: What is the difference between a secured and unsecured credit card?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

This will get the child comfortable with holding and drinking from a cup.  After that, you can gradually increase the amount of water in the cup as the child gets more comfortable.\\n\\nHuman: Won't that make a mess?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s possible that there will be spills.  But, if you keep it to a minimum, it will actually help the child to develop skills like holding a cup and knowing how to balance things while they’re full of liquid.  If a mess does happen, it’s important not to make a big deal about it, and just clean up together.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I see what you mean. Do you have any other advice?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, there are a few other things to keep in mind.  You should make sure the cup is easy to hold.  It’s important to not make the child feel overwhelmed.  If a child doesn’t have a good grasp of what to expect, it can make him or her hesitant.  Also, make sure you don’t put the child down after you’ve given them the cup.  It can be tempting to let them do things on their own, but this should wait until the child is more confident with the cup.\\n\\nHuman: So it should be a small cup?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Do you know much about the artist or his work?\\n\\nAssistant: Andy Warhol is most famous for pop art - paintings and drawings of everyday items and scenes from popular culture.  He developed a number of signature techniques, but one of his most famous was his screenprints, where he projected the image he wanted to print onto a screen or canvas and then traced it.  To produce a large number of these paintings quickly, he developed a \"factory system\" where his assistants would hand paint the paintings for him.\\n\\nFor the series of portraits of pop culture figures he did in 1984, he used a different technique, a stenciled technique, where he would print onto the surface and then sponge over it with ink, creating a spray-paint-like effect.  These canvases are much larger than his usual paintings, so they were often displayed with lights shining behind them.  For this series, he used musicians like Debbie Harry and Freddie Mercury as his models.  The style had some impact on other artists, but the most well-known is Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Basquiat\\'s work incorporated graffiti and tags, and he was known for his spontaneous style of painting, incorporating a lot of media.  He was also very associated with the downtown New York scene, in contrast to\\n\\nHuman: That sounds about right. I love this big hair.\\n\\nAssistant: In his most famous works, he used a technique he called \"SAMO,\" which stands for \"same old shit, different day\".  He would start a painting by covering the canvas in a layer of black paint, then begin to add more color with more layers.  The process was very rough, with lots of texture and unpredictable shapes in the final result.  Some of his other works used graffiti or text as well as painting.  His work is still influential today, in part because it\\'s so varied and it wasn\\'t tied to a specific style.\\n\\nHuman: I know that he and Andy Warhol were close. There were rumors that they were lovers.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Plus, writing down what you’re eating each day can help you identify patterns of over-eating that you didn’t realize you had.\\n\\n-Add exercise into your schedule.  Something as simple as taking a walk for 20-30 minutes every day, or even just going up and down the stairs instead of taking the elevator, can help you burn off some of those excess calories.  Set an alarm on your phone for a few hours every day, so you have a reminder to fit some exercise in.\\n\\nHuman: I do have to exercise more and I like the idea of keeping track of what I eat.\\n\\nAssistant: The other thing I might try if I wanted to change my weight is to find a diet that works for me.  Different diets will be good for different people, so there’s no one diet that works for everybody.  I would start by looking into the five main kinds of diets, and pick one that I think might be a good fit for me.  These are a lot of the “big” diets like low-carb, low-fat, etc.\\n\\nHuman: I never really tried a diet before. Which one do you recommend?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m just going to read you the summary of each of the five main diet types, and then I’d be happy to discuss it with you in more detail if you like.  Hopefully one of these will sound like a good fit!  \\n\\n-Low carb: Consumes very few carbohydrates, usually in a ketogenic state.  You have a “carb free” day, where you consume as few carbohydrates as possible, and then you have “carb up” days, where you can eat whatever you want, as long as it’s mostly carbs.  Supposedly, this “ups” the body’s fat-burning capacity by altering the hormones that regulate hunger and fat storage, so that you naturally eat fewer calories.\\n\\n-Low fat: Similar to low carb, but the “low carb” day is skipped in favor of a “low fat” day.  This is a plan where you consume a\\n\\nHuman: I might try a low carb diet.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

This may seem like an advantage, but streaming may sometimes result in a lack of reliable quality.  For example, in Spotify, the client software tries to automatically buffer up to 15 seconds ahead.  However, users who switch tracks or otherwise pause their playback may find that they’ve lost track of the video/audio they’re watching, since the buffer doesn’t quite catch up.  Additionally, some popular services, such as YouTube, suffer from having a large number of low-quality uploads.  This can affect both video and audio quality, resulting in often pixelated and poorly encoded files.  Another consequence of streaming is that it places a significant processing and storage load on the service.  The larger the subscriber base of a given service, the more difficult it may be for the platform to provide good quality streams.  The distribution of buffering in streams from such large services also results in inconsistent experiences for listeners.\\n\\nHuman: Any other thoughts?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

You need a nice outfit, perhaps with a hat that looks like wings.\\n- Baby is a bunny.  Just dress it up like a bunny and add ears and a tail.  You could make it a bumblebee, which is a bunny that has just a bit of bee features.\\n- Baby is a frog.  Baby could wear green clothes and you could buy a frog costume or find a mask.\\n- Baby is a monkey.  Baby could wear a monkey costume with a tail.\\n- Baby is a cow.  You could dress up your baby like a cow by putting on a cow head with horns and a cow nose.  You can also buy cow accessories to attach.\\n\\nHuman: Anything that are not animals?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you clean shoes with toothpaste?\\n\\nAssistant: First you want to make sure your shoes are really dirty.  Use a rag or paper towel to spread a small amount of toothpaste onto the surface of the shoe.  If they are really dirty, you will see the toothpaste becoming incorporated into the shoe surface, and they will start to look clean.  Now, take a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush and start applying small, gentle strokes in the direction of the shoe surface.  The toothpaste should be spread out thin enough that it's making contact with the shoe surface, and also it should be contained within a boundary, rather than soaking into the shoe.  This helps it stay put, and it also makes it easier for you to spread it in even strokes.\\n\\nNow, start gently stroking back and forth, in the direction of the shoe surface, to work the toothpaste in.  Continue to stroke in the same direction until you've made it look like they're really clean.\\n\\nNext, you want to make sure they're really clean.  Gently set the shoe down on a flat surface, like a countertop or a table, and start applying pressure in the direction of the shoe surface with a separate finger.  This will help you check that\\n\\nHuman: How much toothpaste should I use?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n          \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you get rid of mold?\\n\\nAssistant: There are a few ways you can get rid of mold.  One way is to eliminate the source of the mold, like a leak in your roof, or a flooding basement.  You could also install some kind of mold-fighting device, such as a dehumidifier, or an air purifier.  That can help prevent mold growth.  You can also use bleach or vinegar to kill existing mold.  \\nIf you have mold in your walls or ceiling, you might want to try scraping it off with a putty knife, or prying it off the surface with a screwdriver.  Make sure you wear protective gloves and a facemask.  This is actually something you want to do on a regular basis, because even if you temporarily get rid of the mold you see, it will probably come back again.  If you see mold growing inside a wall or in a ceiling, you\\u2019ll want to call a professional to take care of it for you.  They might need to open up the wall or ceiling to do the job right.  \\nIf you have mold growing in your yard, you\\u2019ll want to try to get rid of it by scraping it off the ground, or by pouring vinegar right on the ground to kill the\\n\\nHuman: Open up the wall?\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9937], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9925], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9933], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_with_rejected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([0.9661], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9223], device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([0.9756], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pairs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\",\n          \"tensor([[  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\\n        [  198,   198, 20490,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256]])\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
